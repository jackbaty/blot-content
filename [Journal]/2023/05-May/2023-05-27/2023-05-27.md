I've started unsubscribing from feeds/people who offer little other than barely-informed hot takes, snarky commentary, or "That's BAD!" finger-pointing.

[Om Malik on the Leica Q3](https://om.co/2023/05/26/whats-wrong-with-leica-q3/):

> No matter how you look at it, the Leica Q3 design team made a classy product feel cheap and inelegant.

Well, that seems like quite an exaggeration, no?

Some folks are not going to like that Leica introduced a flippy screen on the new Q3, and Om is one of them. I haven't handled the Q3 yet (has Om?), but I'll reserve judgement. There's no arguing that a tiltable screen isn't handy, but it's fair to argue whether one is _necessary_. Leica apparently thinks it is, as does every other manufacturer.

Late in the article, Om writes:

> I am not a Leica Q guy. I have never liked the Q range of cameras...

Well then, thanks for your take I guess. I'm a big fan of Om and his work, but this all seems a bit reactionary. All this talk has me really missing my Q2, though.
