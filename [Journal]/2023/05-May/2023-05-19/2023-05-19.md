Software notes (in my Tinderbox daybook) from October 19, 2022:

- I was invited to the Tana early access release
- Tinderbox released a beta with a new file format that looks interesting
- TheBrain v13 was released
- Obsidian went 1.0

What do I want in a note-taking tool today? Usually anything other than what I had yesterday.

[Riccardo Mori on self-driving cars](https://morrick.me/archives/9727):

> Self-driving cars advocates will tell you that the noble goal is to reduce car accidents and make people safer on the road. Thatâ€™s nice and all, but I think a more pragmatic (and cost-effective) solution would be to _educate drivers better_.

We know that Level 5 autonomous vehicles are hard to make. Maybe impossible. But "better drivers"? A noble idea, but who are we kidding?
