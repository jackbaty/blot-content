Summary: Wavelength, Micro.blog, Paper

It's mostly the sound of crickets in the [Wavelength](https://www.wavelength.app/) groups I'm in. Wavelength solves the problems it sets out to solve around groups, threads, etc. but I'm beginning to think that not many people consider those problems big enough to merit using a whole new app. And I've yet to see any group interact with AI in a chat.

I like the always-moving-forwardness of paper. Everything new goes in the next available blank space. It's nice not having to think about it.
