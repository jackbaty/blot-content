# Sunday, May 7, 2023

I've been putting my daily notes/journal entries here at Baty.net for nearly a month and I've decided it's totally fine. I've always thought I should keep my random short notes separate from "real" blog posts but it turns out to be unnecessary. People can barely be bothered to visit one blog. Asking them to follow two of them feels presumptuous and maybe a little rude.

[Tana](https://tana.inc/) is quite a compelling package, but after using it for a week I found it to be [exhausting](https://baty.net/2022/personal-knowledge-management). I still occasionally check in to see how it feels and what new features have been added. I have (had?) no plans to integrate it into my workflow. It hasn't felt like it offered enough to justify the planned $20/month subscription price. However, today I learned that they're [now thinking $10/month](https://tana.inc/pricing). Hmmm.
