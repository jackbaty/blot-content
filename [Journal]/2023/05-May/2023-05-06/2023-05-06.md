I had to call the IRS about an issue with my tax returns. It was surprisingly not unpleasant.

I didn't think I needed something like [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/) on my Mac, but turns out I use it many times every day. Recommended.

I'm spending time today consolidating several Lightroom (Classic) libraries. In recent years, I've created a new library for the new year and then I'd merge them the following year. The idea was that it's nice to start "fresh" and not have to lug around 100k images all the time. Turns out that managing separate libraries is work, too, so I'm ditching that plan. One big catalog in LrC is fast enough, and less work.

I like the _idea_ of federation, but in practice (by Mastodon) does not instill confidence in the network. If Bluesky can implement federation as well as they have onboarding, I worry about Mastodon. 

Also, right now Bluesky is a brimming with trans people having a blast. Meanwhile, Mastodon is loaded with people defensively sour-graping about "proper" federation or scolding each other about CWs. I don't need to tell you which one is more fun.
