# Sunday, May 21, 2023

I read [bsag's post about Neovim](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/neovim-again/) again recently so of course I spent hours configuring [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and friends. It's a nice setup, and feels a bit like Doom Emacs. But I can't do it without Org-mode.

I've been sitting in front of this computer for a week[^week] doing nothing but clicking things hoping to find something to play with. Maybe it's time for a break.


[^week]: More like a decade, if I'm being honest.
