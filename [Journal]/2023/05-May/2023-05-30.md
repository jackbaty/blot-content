You may have noticed that these daily journal posts have been expanding to include what would normally be separate blog posts. This has been an organic process, and continues to evolve. Part of me prefers this one-a-day writing process. It’s easy to manage and lets me combine short and long-form content as well as images, quotes, etc. This can all be in a day’s journal. On the other hand, I no longer have an easily-parsable list of posts. It makes the [Archives](https://baty.net/archives/) less useful. At least the PaperMod theme automatically generates links to each heading.

I switched to Arq backup a couple weeks ago because it feels like I have more control of things using Arq. However, after a few days of successful backups, I’m no longer able to either back up to Arq’s cloud, nor can I see the current backups. Support is working on it. I’m able to back up to a Backblaze B2 location, but not to Arq’s cloud. See what I get for “improving” my process?
