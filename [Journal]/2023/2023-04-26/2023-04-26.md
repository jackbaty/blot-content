I'm testing [Captee](http://yummymelon.com/captee/) on macOS. Captee adds an item to Share menus which convert links to either Markdown or Org-mode. It's the Org-mode part I'm most interested in, but I just used it for grabbing that Captee link in Markdown, too. (h/t [Mike Hall](https://mike.puddingtime.org/posts/2023-04-25-daily-notes/))

I fired up an Alt Twitter account this morning so I could shit-post a bit, and I feel dirty but that's really all Twitter is good for now.
