This site doesn't have a "dark mode" because I don't like dark modes and it's my site, so there! It's also a slight rebellion against the silly idea that  light themes "burn out the readers sight at night."[^1] Hyperbole much? Those are my reactive, contrarian reasons. The actual reason is that I'm lazy and don't feel like putting in the work. I understand that it can be an accessibility issue for a small percentage of people, so I'll get to it one day. Until then, the rest of you can turn down your monitor or wait until morning ðŸ˜œ. There's also RSS.

I dislike threads on Twitter and Mastodon so much. Cory Doctorow wrote a post called [How To Make the Least-Worst Mastodon Threads](https://doctorow.medium.com/how-to-make-the-least-worst-mastodon-threads-daa33943ac31) that offers a few tips to make them less awful, but they're still awful. He also, naturally, posted this as a [thread on Mastodon](https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/110209314498880289) in which he basically broke up the Medium post into screenshots of the text. Sigh.

I'm ashamed of how poorly I react to new information that doesn't fit my models or beliefs. I don't know how to effectively reduce my own bias. Time helps, usually.
