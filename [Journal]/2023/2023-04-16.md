My right wrist hurts when I move it certain ways. I don't think it's carpal tunnel but I've switched out my mouse for a trackpad to see if it makes a difference.

What should I do with the Synology? The only app I use regularly is Plex. Otherwise, it's a place to dump archives and backups. I have two external USB drives hooked to my MBP that can do that work instead. Seems like overkill to have a giant NAS just buzzing away in the corner, doing not much of anything.

I've replaced homebrewed emacs-mac @28 with emacs-plus @29 on my MBP. After running `./bin/doom sync` it launched without a hitch so far. Shocking. I used the following:

```sh
brew install  emacs-plus@29 --with-imagemagick \
                            --with-no-frame-refocus \
                            --with-native-comp \
                            --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon
```

That last bit gives me an app icon that looks like this. Purrdy.

I have a draft post that I'll never publish titled, "The radicalization of Dr. John Campbell" and it makes me sad. Not because I won't publish it, but because I felt the need to write it in the first place.

The "I'm a good driver" syndrome is everywhere.

You know what I hate? Gossip. Whenever I'm in a bad mood it's often on the days that the internet feels like nothing but a giant gossip engine.
