I love this photo, taken by my dad while traveling to France during his time in the Navy. There's just so much going on.

I write on paper a lot, and mostly in cursive. I don't understand, then, why my handwriting has become so much worse recently. Is it laziness? It can't be old age. Not yet anyway. It kind of puts me off writing that way.

Phil has been keeping copious [Darkroom notes](https://www.twelvety.net/2023/04/darkroom-notes-from-april-12) and I'm quite envious. I work fast and loose in the darkroom and so far I've been OK with that approach, but Phil's notes make me want to try being somewhat more fastidious about it.
