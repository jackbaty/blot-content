Bluesky really does feel like early Twitter. I'm not sure how long it will last. It's different than Mastodon. There's room for both, maybe. (Or perhaps [neither](https://baty.net/2023/im-weary-of-social-media)).

The world is full of people who take themselves far too seriously. I'm reminded of this with every visit to LinkedIn.

After a day of frustration with all of the social networks, I'm taking a break. I'm exhausted and disgusted by all of it. Stepping back is healthy.
