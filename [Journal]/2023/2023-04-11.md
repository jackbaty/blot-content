In the heady rush of a [new blogging workflow](/2023/blot-is-just-right), I often contemplate including my [daily notes](https://daily.baty.net) here rather than on a separate blog. I mean, why not? It's not _that_ disruptive, is it? You're soaking in it.

How does one find alignment between values, work, and interests?

There are times I would like to take this website seriously. Those times pass quickly when I (re)learn that good writing about interesting things takes time. And talent. And patience. And commitment. So I'm back to short, off-the-cuff, poorly-written blurbs.

I have no idea what's actually happening in Succession. I just like listening to the words.
