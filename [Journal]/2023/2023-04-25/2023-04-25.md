# Tuesday, April 25, 2023

I give social media a hard time and often consider quitting altogether. I would love to be one of those people who get by with no social media presence at all. So of course I joined [Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/) the second I received an invite code (thanks @maique.eu).

Bluesky lets you use your own domain name as a handle, so I'm @baty.net.
