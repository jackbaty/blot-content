<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbaty/52820149368/in/dateposted-public/" title="My dad on Easter"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52820149368_db98d3df8a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="819" alt="My dad on Easter"/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I snapped this photo of my dad from across the room with the 35mm Sigma. This edit is a severely cropped version, but it's still 3300px wide. Sometimes having all those extra megapixels in the SL2 comes in handy.

Sorry about the RSS noise after that last post. I keep forgetting that any image placed in Blot's directory hierarchy is automatically turned into a photo post unless its file begins with "_".
