I just spent 2 hours watching YouTube videos of other people doing stuff. What a waste.

I want the medium and the subject to make the image, not the computer.

Here's a picture of the plant on my desk. No reason other than I just noticed it.

I bought an Apple Magsafe Wallet for my iPhone 12 Mini and so far I hate it.
