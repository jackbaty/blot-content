The critic whose downvote dropped [Marcel the Shell With Shoes On](https://letterboxd.com/film/marcel-the-shell-with-shoes-on-2021/)'s Rotten Tomatoes score to 99% must be a heartless, contrarian asshole.

In less than a year, most blog posts are going to be littered with cool-but-unnecessary AI-generated images instead of stock or Unsplash photos as they do today. Oh goody.

Two rules in life: First, never sell a Leica. Second, never switch blogging platforms. (PS I never obey those rules and have come to regret it)
