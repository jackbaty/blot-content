Every day I wake up older.

This is quite a thread about using, but never learning, Emacs. Feels familiar: [Can't learn Emacs, can't use anything else](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/x4uo5v/cant_learn_emacs_cant_use_anything_else_rant/)

I changed the font here to HK Grotesk because Signika felt a little heavy.

It's a little weird having these "journal" posts included in the site's RSS feed, since when first published they are nearly empty. What I *should* do is keep them as drafts until there's more meat on their bones. Or perhaps there's a way to trigger their inclusion in the RSS feed separately from "Draft" status.

I spent some time in the darkroom this morning catching up on contact sheets and making a few quick prints from recent rolls. I'm not sure if I love it or hate it.

How could I *not* want one of these keyboards? [Office Altar I](https://electronicmaterialsoffice.com/).

It's possible I could move back into Org-roam from Denote. I prefer the simplicity of Denote but Org-roam has it all, and Doom makes it all work pretty well.
