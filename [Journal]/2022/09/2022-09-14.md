I'm experimenting with using [Olivetti mode](https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti) in Doom rather than Doom's default [Writeroom mode](https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode). Writeroom mode is a bit too aggressive. All I really want is to add some nice border spacing around lines with a maximum width.
