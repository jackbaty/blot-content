[Alex](https://alexjj.com) referred to one of his blogs as his "daily waffle" and I feel seen. My whole life is a daily waffle. No matter what I'm doing today, it should be assumed that it'll change tomorrow.

I'm moving a bunch of domains from iwantmyname.com to [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/) even though I just read about them having a prolonged outage. Is that weird? That seems weird. But, I had a few domains scheduled to renew at iwantmyname and they're rather expensive so let's try it. Several people I know seem to love Porkbun.

Shortly before and shortly after Apple events is a good time to stay out of the "blogosphere".

I'm holding out for the Apple Watch Yowza.

[Migrate TiddlyWiki to Org-roam: Part 1](https://blog.dornea.nu/2022/09/03/migrate-tiddlywiki-to-org-roam-part-1-export-tiddlers/) I'm writing this down, but I'm not going to actually try it, nope, not doing it.
