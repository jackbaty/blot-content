It's been about a week using [Blot](https://blot.im) and so far I'm thrilled to be back. I've never stuck with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for my general notes but for editing Markdown files for publishing with Blot, it's quite nice. The combination is pretty sweet.

I've listed the [Leica MP (Black Paint) for sale](https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1772846/0#16036975). Gasp!

The recent spate of AI tools for generative art are obviously amazing, revolutionary, and exciting. I just can't seem to muster the energy to care.

I am so glad, now that the Mac line is awesome again, that I no longer have thoughts of Dell/Linux running distractingly in the back of my head.

I love the *idea* of manual typewriters. I have several nice ones. But I almost never use them.

Do I really want the artifacts of my life to be a stack of paper notebooks full of repetitive navel-gazing? Because right now that's about all there is.

I'm feeling a digital photography phase coming on. Thinking of re-buying an M10-R. Why not a Q2 or SL2? Because I wan't to try *active* photography rather than passive. I believe that the M helps with that. Why digital? Because I want to focus on taking pictures rather than the medium, process, and accoutrement.

[Blot](https://blot.im) exposes a 404 log of my blog. This is great because it helps determine which content I've missed during migrations and where I need redirects.

Is there such a thing as "old/shiny"? That's what Blot is for me right now.

I just installed [Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/) as my Dropbox client on the MBP because Maestral kept crashing. If you're reading this, it worked. (Update: It worked.)

I have changed my mind about whether or not to capitalize tag names at least 356 times. #Standards #consistency

I just reread "[Anything You Want](https://sive.rs/a)" by Derek Sivers. He mentions the dangers of trying to "impress an invisible jury" and I realized that I do that all the time.

Shhhh, I'm typing this in Emacs.
