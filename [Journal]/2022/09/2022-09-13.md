With much help from David (Blot's creator), I have now imported nearly all of the posts from the Hugo version of baty.net. I skipped some short posts and a handful of journal entries, but I feel like the important stuff is here now. 

I withdrew the Leica MP listing. I just couldn't go through with the sale of what might be the most beautiful camera ever made. I bought it brand new and I know that I would never allow myself to do that again.

This is handy: [Emacs as an Org capture server](https://gist.github.com/progfolio/af627354f87542879de3ddc30a31adc1)

Also trying this for natural language searching of my Org files: [Khoj](https://github.com/debanjum/khoj#Demo)

We're having internet installed at our (empty) office building so us three remaining owners can work there. Why not, it's just sitting there waiting for someone to lease it.
