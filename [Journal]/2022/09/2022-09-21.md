Yep, still thrilled with [Blot.im](https://blot.im) for running this blog.

I have a lifetime subscription to [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) and it's easily the best music player/streamer/library there is. The one big drawback with using Roon is that it only works on my local LAN. If I'm, say, in the car, I can't listen to my Roon library or playlists, etc. Yesterday Roon 2.0 was released, and it solves this problem. There's a new app, [Arc](https://roonlabs.com/arc), which connects to my Roon Core (running on an old Intel NUC) and lets me stream anywhere. So far it works great.

[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) turned 18 years old this week. I wonder if we'll be saying the same thing one day about Notion, Craft, Roam, etc. I have doubts.
