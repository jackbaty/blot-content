Phil [writes glowingly about David Merfield and Blot](https://twelvety.blot.im/posts/2022/09/david-merfield-blot) and I couldn't agree more.

Does anyone know, assuming I could generate a single HTML page with every post, if I could make a nice book out of it using something like [Paged.js](https://pagedjs.org/)? I'd like to do that.

Saw John Mulaney last night and it was a "no phone" event meaning they bagged all phones and smart watches for the duration. I wore my mechanical watch and you wouldn't believe how many people asked me for the time.
