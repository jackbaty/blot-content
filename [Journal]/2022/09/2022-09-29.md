I think I'll try moving these daily posts out of baty.net. Perhaps they belong on [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). Perhaps they don't belong anywhere at all. I do know that I don't like them in my RSS feed. In a related event, I restarted my [micro.blog](https://jack.micro.blog) subscription. That's where I used to post random thoughts and images. I also cross-post from there to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jackbaty) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.technology/@jackbaty), which I'm sort of opposed to but there we are. So, click Like and Subscribe, I guess?

Part (most?) of me wants to be separate from that whole thing, but I wonder if it's just my version of "I don't even _have_ a television!"
