My tendency to write daily posts here vs the wiki is tied to how deep I am into Emacs at the moment. Right now‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs _very deep_.

I‚Äôve spent hours configuring my [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com) setup so I can publish certain notes as a website. It‚Äôs so cool, but in the end I‚Äôm not sure it offers clear advantages over the wiki other than that I can make some of my roam notes public without needing to rewrite them in TiddlyWiki. WIP is here: notes.baty.net. **Later**: now I‚Äôve realized that I can simply add some [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) metadata to any of my Org files and have them publish to this daily notes blog. Like so‚Ä¶

    #+hugo_base_dir: ~/sites/daily.baty.net/
    #+hugo_section: ./notes/
    

Now what!?

Apparently I have too much time on my hands.

I went into the darkroom to test a new safelight bulb and made a handful of 5x7 prints while I was in there. I love real photos. The decision to print a photo automatically makes that photo special.

Ordered a book: [No One Is Talking about This - a book by Patricia Lockwood](https://bookshop.org/books/no-one-is-talking-about-this/9780593189580)

‚ÄúComputational Photography‚Äù can fuck right off.
