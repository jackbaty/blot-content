# Followers on Micro.blog - Ron Chester

> There are no visible scores on Microblog. This is a very good thing. It means I can just concentrate on posting things others might find interesting and then being interested in things I might find posted by others. There’s no way to tell who’s popular, nor a way to game a system to look more popular. I hope that doesn’t change.

Social networks benefit greatly from encouraging users to “game the system” any way they can in order to bump their “score”. I’m in full agreement with Ron  that hiding any sort of popularity metric is a great feature of [Micro.blog][2]. I hope Manton and Co. can resist the urge to change it.
