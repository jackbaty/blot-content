# The Leica SL2-S = Instabuy

![](/_img/2020/sl2-s.jpg)

When I [bought a used Leica SL(601) recently](__GHOST_URL__/2020/my-new-5-year-old-leica-sl/) instead of the newer SL2 , it was mostly because I didnâ€™t want to spend $6,000 on a camera that I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d love. But it was also _partly_ because I really donâ€™t need a 47-megapixel sensor. Whoâ€™s got the time and space to manage 80MB per image photos?

Iâ€™ve had the SL for a month and thatâ€™s long enough to know that I love it. Itâ€™s big but not too big. Itâ€™s an absolute tank, build-wise, and itâ€™s fast and fun to use. Iâ€™m happy. I can shoot my M-mount Leica lenses on it and am finding it even easier to focus them on the SL than I do on the M10-P. So everythingâ€™s good then. I wish it had IBIS, though.

And then, just this morning, [Leica announced the SL2-S](https://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-SL/Leica-SL2-S) . The SL2-S is, from my standpoint, an updated SL that adds everything in the SL2 except the giant sensor. The SL2-S has a 24 Megapixel sensor, which is a sweet spot for me. It also improves focusing, low-light capabilities, and of course includes IBIS. In other words, itâ€™s exactly what I wanted in the SL2. And to top it off, itâ€™s more than $1,000 _cheaper_ than the SL2.

Apparently the SL2-S is being marketed as a hybrid still/video powerhouse. I guess the video features are great, but I donâ€™t care as much about that. I care about speed, handling, image quality, and reasonable file sizes. Proper video is a nice bonus, though.

Iâ€™ve already sold my beloved M10-P and preordered an SL2-S. I have no idea when itâ€™ll arrive, but I can hardly wait.
