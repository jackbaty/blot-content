# TiddlyBlink on Glitch

[Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/20/tiddlyblink-glitch/):

> While Anne-Laureâ€™s post walks through how to self-host or set up a local instance easily none of the web options for TiddlyWiki seemed very satisfying so I went fiddlingâ€¦
> I quickly discovered this excellent TiddlyWiki reference project on Glitch from Thomas Elmiger.
> So all I did was remix this project - install TiddlyBlink and hey presto it works out of the box!

He's right, it does work right out of the box. I made this in 2 minutes...

https://tabby-endurable-territory.glitch.me

It requires authentication in order to edit anything, but allows for anonymous access otherwise. An ideal configuration for a public hosted wiki with next-to-zero setup. It's stock TiddlyWiki with the Roam-like backlinking features of [TiddlyBlink](https://giffmex.org/gifts/tiddlyblink.html) pre-installed.

I should spend more time in Glitch.
