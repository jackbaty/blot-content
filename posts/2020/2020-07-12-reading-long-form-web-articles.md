# Reading Long-Form Web Articles By Printing Them First

This [tweet by Mike Lee Williams](https://twitter.com/mikepqr/status/1275862104851877890) started something:

I look at a lot of articles on the web. And by “look at” I mean “skim distractedly without actually reading”. What happens is that I click a link and sort of scan the article until becoming distracted or interrupted by something else on the screen. I waste a lot of time this way, with little gain.

Mike’s approach to reading articles makes sense to me, so I’ve adopted a similar process and it’s working well.

I no longer try to read longer-form articles right away. I instead send them to Instapaper and, after a day or two, review the inbox, delete the ones I no longer care about, and print the ones I do. For printing, I use [Mike’s user stylesheet](https://gist.github.com/williamsmj/3042d8c3e7da25907c5ce623c8e2b129/) for Firefox reader mode. The print layout is compact and readable and I can mark them up with a pencil and highlighter while away from the distractions of a screen.

I keep recent articles scattered around my desk until I feel I’ve gotten what I need out of them. I then scan the marked up versions into [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) and manually enter the highlights from the most important articles into [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/).

This print-first process is a good way for me to actually learn from things I find on the web.
