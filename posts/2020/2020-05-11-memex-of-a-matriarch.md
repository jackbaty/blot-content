# Memex of a Matriarch - Violeta Kristof

[Violeta Kristof](https://www.roambrain.com/the-memex-of-a-matriarch/):

> I make a case for doing family caring as a nerdy enterprise. Nerdily and ambitiously aspiring to become a good matriarch, regardless of the moral case for it. And matriarchs need databases. Iâ€™m making mine, with Roam Research, to grow into the Memex of a Matriarch, an â€œenlarged intimate supplement to [my] memoryâ€œ.

Another interesting use of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com)
