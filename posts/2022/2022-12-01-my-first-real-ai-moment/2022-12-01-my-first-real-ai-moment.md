# My first real AI moment

Iâ€™m a latecomer to AI, but I just had my first real AI revelation moment while usingÂ [OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). I asked it an honest question that I had and got a complete, sensible, and correct answer. Itâ€™s like if Google had a brain, or if I asked an assistant to look something up for me and report back. Hereâ€™s part of the thread:

Can you imagine where this leads? I didnâ€™t reallyÂ _get_Â it, until having the above conversation. Iâ€™d love being in high school right now. Itâ€™s like being in that brief period where calculators were still rare, so having one was like cheating. AI feels like cheating, in a good way.

This feels like the first time I dragged and resized a filled shape in MacPaint on my Macintosh Plus. Or the first time I pinched-to-zoom on the original iPhone.
