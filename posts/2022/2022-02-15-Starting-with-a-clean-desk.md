# Starting with a clean desk

![My workspace](/_img/2022/02/20220214-Q1000302.jpg)

My home office environment was getting out of hand, clutter-wise. They say that a messy desk is the sign of a creative mind. Maybe so, but Iâ€™m more of a tidy desk person.

Iâ€™ll sometimes notice that Iâ€™m easily provoked, frustrated, or otherwise feeling edgy. Then Iâ€™ll clean my office and I _always_ feel better.

The worst thing for me is to set something on my desk because I donâ€™t yet know where Iâ€™m going to put it. Then it just sits there, for weeks, nagging me out of the corner of my eye. Drives me nuts. Or, Iâ€™ll knock something over or cords will tangle or Iâ€™ll be unable to find something because itâ€™s under something else. Aargh!

My workspace doesnâ€™t need to be a minimalist, Instagram-worthy setup. It just needs to be organized and tidy. I cleaned my desk yesterday and have been in a better mood since. ????
