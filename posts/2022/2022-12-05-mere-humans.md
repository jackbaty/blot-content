# Mere humans

AI continues to enthrall everyone. Here’s DHH on AI creativity vs humans:

> Why shouldn’t the same be true of AI generated novels, plays, or movies? What realm of creative production does not benefit from the out-of-the-norm inferences that computers have already proven they can make within the bounds of chess and go to great effect? Is what we call human creativity all that different from a large language model anyway? A distillation of observations, inputs, mimetic tendencies, and a wetware random generator?

Fair questions. I just wish he wouldn’t keep calling us “mere humans”.

I was playing with the amazing [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and it felt like something new. Using it felt like the first time I dragged to resize a filled shape in MacPaint on my Macintosh Plus.

I imagine that before too long, just like filled shapes in a drawing program, AI will become just another boring, everyday tool. But not today. Today, to this mere human, it’s magic.
