# The Daily Notes Dilemma

You see, I have [a nice wiki](https://rl.baty.net/) , and for a couple of years, I have written a new entry in it (nearly) every day. These “daily notes” have been interspersed and interlinked with the rest of the wiki’s content. It works, but I don’t love it.

Writing in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is fine. It’s super easy, but it’s also a little clunky, which quickly becomes friction. And the experience for visitors is weird if you’re not familiar with TiddlyWiki. Also, there’s no RSS feed. I sometimes consider this a feature, because it’s nice writing freely and knowing it’s not “going anywhere”. On the other hand, if I were someone wanting to follow along with me, I’d want a damn RSS feed.

So, I periodically waffle between writing my daily posts on the wiki and on a “real” blog. One thing that has kept me in the wiki is that I can easily link things from my daily notes posts to the more permanent entries. This helps build a network of links. I love the _idea_of all this linking back and forth, but in practice, it’s not as useful as I’d hoped. TiddlyWiki works better when each distinct idea or thing is created as a separate “tiddler”. I’ll create a new tiddler about something, link to that something, and then transclude the tiddler in that day’s daily. And then I almost never actually _take advantage of_ all that work. So why bother? I mean, it’s not as if I’m trying to build some sort of [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) here.

I love writing in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and keeping everything [formatted as Org-mode files](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) . I like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for blogging and I like the way the rendered site looks. TiddlyWiki is easier overall but Emacs/Org/Hugo is more fun for me and I believe it results in a nicer experience for visitors.

All that to say I’m once again back to using a “real” blog for my daily notes. I’ve committed enough to this that I’ve added a link in the navigation here. You can follow along at [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/) .

An RSS feed for daily.baty.net is available both [on its own](https://daily.baty.net/index.xml) and as part of my [Everything Feed](__GHOST_URL__/everything) .

**UPDATE (May 19, 2022):** The wiki is once again seeing most of my daily notes posts.
