# My first salt-water aquarium

![](/_img/2022/20220708-featuredImage.jpg)

When I was a kid I kept a small, fresh-water aquarium. It was fun, but I always knew that the really cool fish lived in salt water. Fast forward 40 years or so and I’ve finally put together a salt-water “reef” aquarium.

I’ve started small because there seems to be quite a percentage of people who bail on them within the first year or so. I want to be sure it sticks before spending tons of money and going all-in.

I went with the “beginner” [BioCube 32](https://www.saltwateraquarium.com/32-gallon-biocube-aquarium-w-led-kit-tank-stand-coralife/). I set the tank up the first week of June. Added “live” rock and sand. Put in an additional powerhead pump for better flow, and waited. “Aquascaping” the aquarium was fun. I think I have a configuration that looks nice and also leaves plenty of nooks and crannies for critters to hide in.

New tanks need to go through an initial [Nitrogen cycle](https://www.thebeginnersreef.com/fish-tank-nitrogen-cycle-step-by-step-explanation/) before adding any fish or corals. Using live rocks and sand helps move this along. I tested my water for Ammonia and Nitrites every day or two, and after two weeks it was ready.

I bought my first fish, an [Ocellaris Clownfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellaris_clownfish), on July 3rd. Clowns are everyone’s first fish. They’re cool and easy to care for, so why not? Mine is a “designer” Black Clown. We named him “Marcus” for no particular reason.

Isn’t he cute! (All clowns are born male).

Since Marcus seemed to be doing well, I added another fish yesterday. A [Bicolor Blenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecsenius_bicolor). We named this one “Benny”. (I know).

I haven’t taken a photo of him yet because he’s still hiding in a hole on the rocks. I did take a snap while acclimating him. Acclimation involves slowly adding water (drip by drip) from my aquarium into his water from the local fish store ([Water Colors Aquarium Gallery](https://watercolorsaquariumgallery.com/))

I also added a couple of Astrea snails in anticipation of algae growth.

So far, so good. There’s a lot to learn about keeping a reef tank. Water parameters are critical, especially with coral. I can’t wait to start adding coral! There are feeding issues, cleaning, filtering, diseases, livestock problems, and on and on. It’s awesome so far. I love fish!
