# Do I want to write or do I want to fiddle with my blog?

Apparently, the answer is…fiddle with my blog. (Or maybe write _about_ fiddling with my blog.)

I spent (aka wasted) many hours yesterday futzing with WordPress and Hugo. The day began with thinking about moving baty.net back to Hugo. I love writing in Emacs and using Org-mode files for publishing.

I feel like I’m a static website person. I want my site to be nothing more than a simple folder full of HTML files on a web server somewhere. Mmmm, fast, lightweight, future-proof, secure.

I also want to post by clicking a button, typing, and clicking another button. I want images to be managed for me. I want analytics, comments, and easy upgrades.

So, basically I want HugoPress. There is no such thing. None of the web front ends to Hugo are any good, so that’s out. I just want both sets of features and to pick and choose on the fly. I can’t have that, so historically I have kept two blogs, one static, one (usually) WordPress. Then I can use each set of features as needed. Except that splits my content and I don’t want that either.

Instead of writing, then, I continue to waffle about platforms. I recently made the “and that’s that!” decision to go all-in with WordPress. Once running, WordPress is the easiest way to get words published, and that’s why we’re here, right? So there!

And yet…
