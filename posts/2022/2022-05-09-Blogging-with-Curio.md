# Blogging with Curio

Iâ€™ve used [Zengobi Curio](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/) for many years when I needed a visual system for managing projects and associated files. In a recent version, Curio gained a [Journal](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/docs/18/journal/?) feature. Itâ€™s fairly rudimentary compared to dedicated journal apps, but I recently started testing it as a way to create a sort of scrapbook each day. It works pretty well for that. I export a PDF of the dayâ€™s entry, print it, and put it in a binder.

While farting around with Curio exports, I tried exporting a few entries as HTML and was surprised how much fidelity is maintained when exporting. For giggles, I uploaded a few daysâ€™ exports to a web server. I had a crazy idea that this could be a daily blog. [Here is my test site](https://curio.baty.net/2022/).

Itâ€™s neat, right? I slap images, notes, cards, mindmaps, lists, _anything_ on the dayâ€™s entry, and it ends up as a web page.

While a fun experiment, I donâ€™t think it makes sense long-term, since the resulting web pages are a mess on mobile, offer no accessibility, and managing navigation, etc. is a pain. Still, itâ€™s a neat trick and I may throw pages out there every once in a while, just for fun.
