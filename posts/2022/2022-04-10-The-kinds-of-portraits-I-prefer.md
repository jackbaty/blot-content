# The kinds of portraits I preferâ€¦Judith Joy Ross, for example

![Photo by Judith Joy Ross](/_img/2022/ross-4.png)

I recently read Joe McNallyâ€™s book, [The Real Deal: Field Notes from the Life of a Working Photographer](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Deal-Field-Working-Photographer/dp/1681988011/) . While I found his anecdotes occasionally interesting, I didnâ€™t really enjoy the book. I think this was because I donâ€™t much care for McNallyâ€™s photographs. Hereâ€™s one of his portraits.

Thereâ€™s no question that McNally is a talented photographer with a powerful work ethic and serious technical skills. His portraits, however, leave me uninspired. You know the style. Creatively lit with a handful of Speedlights, carefully arranged backgrounds or sets, wardrobe and makeup people, etc. The kinds of photos that get a shit ton of likes. This style is not for me.

Now, [Judith Joy Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Joy_Ross) , on the other hand, makes deeply moving, personal portraits while wandering around with an 8x10 view camera. I wasnâ€™t familiar with her work until recently. I mean, just look at theseâ€¦

Simply fantastic work. I just ordered her new book: [Judith Joy Ross: Photographs 1978â€“2015](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597115223/) .
