# Alan Moore on comics

[Watchmen author Alan Moore: ‘I’m definitely done with comics’](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/07/watchmen-author-alan-moore-im-definitely-done-with-comics):

> I said round about 2011 that I thought that it had serious and worrying implications for the future if millions of adults were queueing up to see Batman movies. Because that kind of infantilisation – that urge towards simpler times, simpler realities – that can very often be a precursor to fascism.

And this:

> Hundreds of thousands of adults \[are\] lining up to see characters and situations that had been created to entertain the 12-year-old boys – and it __was__ always boys – of 50 years ago. I didn’t really think that superheroes were adult fare.
