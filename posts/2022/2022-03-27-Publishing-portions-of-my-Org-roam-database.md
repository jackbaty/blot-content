# Publishing portions of my Org-roam database

Iâ€™m trying something new.

Iâ€™ve become a pretty heavy user of [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) Â for personal notes. I put nearly everything there now; technical notes, contact information, project notes, vendor info, etc. These notes are all nicely linked and backlinked and live in my main ~/org directory so I can easily find things right within Emacs.

A portion of these notes might be useful to other people. So Iâ€™m exporting the shareable notes from Org-roam as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) -compatible Markdown files. This turned out to be surprisingly easy. You can see the results at [https://notes.baty.net](https://notes.baty.net/) and the [details of how it works](https://notes.baty.net/notes/publishing_portions_of_my_org_roam_database/) makes a good example.

Iâ€™m sure there are a dozen ways to do this, but this seems to work quite well.
