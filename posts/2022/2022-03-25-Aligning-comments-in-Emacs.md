# Aligning comments in Emacs

I want my per-line code comments to line up nicely, so Iâ€™ll often add a bunch of spaces by hand to make things just so. I realized that, being Emacs, there must be an easier way to handle this. Of course there is.

Two minutes of searching [revealed a short bit of lisp](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20278032) that does the job nicely:

```lisp
    ;; Align comments in marked region
    ;; Via https://stackoverflow.com/a/20278032
    (defun jab/align-comments (beginning end)
      "Align comments within marked region."
      (interactive "*r")
      (let (indent-tabs-mode align-to-tab-stop)
        (align-regexp beginning end (concat "\(\s-*\)"
                                            (regexp-quote comment-start)))))
```    

Hereâ€™s an example of what I was working on, with horribly un-aligned comments.

```lisp
    (setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" plain "%?"
        :target (file+head "%<%Y%m%d>-${slug}.org"
                           "#+title: ${title}n#+index: n#+setupfile: ~/org/_SETUP/EXPORTn#+setupfile: ~/org/_SETUP/org-roam-publish-fancy.setup")
        :unnarrowed t)
        ("P" ;; Key
         "Public (published in /public)" ;; Description
         plain  ;; Type
         (file "~/org/roam/templates/PublicTemplate.org")  ;; Template
        :target (file "public/${slug}.org") ;; Target
        :unnarrowed t)
        ("p" ;; Key
         "project"  ;; Description
         plain   ;; Type
         (file "~/org/roam/templates/ProjectTemplate.org") ;; Template
        :target (file "projects/%<%Y%m%d>-${slug}.org")    ;; Target
        :unnarrowed t)))
```

Then, hereâ€™s that same thing after executing `jab/align-comments`

```lisp
    (setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" plain "%?"
        :target (file+head "%<%Y%m%d>-${slug}.org"
                           "#+title: ${title}n#+index: n#+setupfile: ~/org/_SETUP/EXPORTn#+setupfile: ~/org/_SETUP/org-roam-publish-fancy.setup")
        :unnarrowed t)
        ("P"                                               ;; Key
         "Public (published in /public)"                   ;; Description
         plain                                             ;; Type
         (file "~/org/roam/templates/PublicTemplate.org")  ;; Template
        :target (file "public/${slug}.org")                ;; Target
        :unnarrowed t)
        ("p"                                               ;; Key
         "project"                                         ;; Description
         plain                                             ;; Type
         (file "~/org/roam/templates/ProjectTemplate.org") ;; Template
        :target (file "projects/%<%Y%m%d>-${slug}.org")    ;; Target
        :unnarrowed t)))
```    

Much better. Itâ€™s cool because it uses `comment-start` so it works with any languageâ€™s comment syntax. There are probably 17 other ways of doing this that I havenâ€™t discovered, but this works.

Every day is a new day in Emacs.
