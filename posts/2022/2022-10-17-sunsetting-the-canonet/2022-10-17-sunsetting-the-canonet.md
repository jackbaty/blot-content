# Sunsetting the Canonet

This is probably the last roll Iâ€™ll run through the Canonet. I canâ€™t seem to focus it and I donâ€™t trust the shutter speeds. Also, it has scratched a couple of negatives and the frame spacing is all over the place. Itâ€™s a nice camera to look at, so thatâ€™s how itâ€™ll spend its remaining days.

Here are a few more from that last roll. I told you I canâ€™t focus it.
