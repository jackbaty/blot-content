# Feelings about the Leica M10-R

I‚Äôm feeling twitchy about owning the [Leica M10-R](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/m/m10-r-black) .

The M10-R is an astonishingly good camera. World-beating build quality, timeless design, and a fantastic 40-megapixel sensor, all in a small, beautiful package.

Still available new in 2022 for an [eye-watering $8,995](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1571535-REG/leica_m10_r_digital_rangefinder_camera.html) (I bought mine used), the M10-R is also a ridiculously expensive camera. Buying one is a big deal and a significant investment.

I am fortunate enough to also own [Leica M film cameras](__GHOST_URL__/2021/betting-long-on-film-with-a-new-leica-mp/), and being able to share lenses between those and the M10-R is very handy. And OMG those Leica lenses! The control layout and handling are the same as well. It‚Äôs like having both a digital and film platform for using 70 years of tiny, wonderful Leica lenses. I can carry a full film and digital arsenal with 2 bodies and lenses in a tiny bag.

So, why am I feeling twitchy?

I worry about having such expensive, relatively delicate equipment swinging about around my neck. It makes me nervous. It‚Äôs hard to relax and make photographs when I‚Äôm so worried about losing or breaking the camera I‚Äôm carrying.

Unlike film Ms, digital M cameras depreciate steadily in value. Not as quickly as other digital cameras, perhaps, but still, the trend is downward.

But mostly, I feel guilty having such a fine camera because I‚Äôve barely used it. I‚Äôve been shooting mostly film for the past month or so, leaving the M10-R idling in the bag. I can justify the expense for something I‚Äôm using all the time but to have the M10-R sitting in the bag ‚Äújust in case‚Äù is hard to stomach.

Still, I love the camera and I‚Äôm keeping it. At least for now. I know me, and I know that the digital-film pendulum will swing back the other way soon enough, and when it does I‚Äôll be glad I have the M10-R.
