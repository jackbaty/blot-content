# Printing web pages

In 2020 I wrote,

I still print web pages for later reading, but I’ve updated the way it works.

I’ve replaced Instapaper with [Zotero as my read later service](http://localhost:1313/2021/using-zotero-as-a-bookmarking-and-read-later-service/). Zotero is overkill for this, but it’s free, local, and makes the articles I save usable as references if needed.

When I’ve found an article that I want to print and read, I visit the page and use the excellent [Markdownload web clipper extension](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload). Markdownload grabs the meat of the article, converts the HTML to Markdown, and (optionally) adds front matter and metadata to the document. Here’s an example:

# A Tweet Before Dying | WIRED

i find it a good philosophical exercise to imagine the last tweet. It could come centuries hence, when a cryptobot offers a wistful adieu to another cryptobot, or in 2025, when Donald Trump, the newly ...
```

I add the `documentclass` and `classoption` front matter manually. These options are used by [my pandoc template](https://gist.github.com/jackbaty/af608b15aae82349c77b97333829b521)[^1] when converting the Markdown file to PDF using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). The rest is handled automatically by the extension.

Once I have the Markdown file, I convert it to PDF either via a [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) script or [pandoc-mode](http://joostkremers.github.io/pandoc-mode/) in Emacs.

Here’s what the PDF looks like:

After that, it’s off to the printer.

Admittedly, the setup for this took me some time, but now that the hard part is done I can go from web page to a typographically beautiful printed document in about a minute. It’s been totally worth it.

[^1]: My template is just a slightly modified version of the one that comes by default with Pandoc.
