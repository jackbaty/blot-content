# I enjoy processing film

There are things that I dislike about shooting film, but processing isnâ€™t one of them. I actually enjoy it.

I shoot a roll or two of film each week and process it in my bathroom darkroom. Developing black and white film is quite simple. I have gotten to a point where the process is muscle memory. I shoot mostly the same type of film (HP5 Plus) and develop it in HC-110. I know the dilutions and I know the time, temperature, and agitation schedule.

It takes me about 20 minutes to develop a roll of film. I have to pay attention for five minutes in the developer, one minute in stop bath, then five minutes in the fixer. After that, itâ€™s a hands-off ten-minute wash, a quick dip in Photo-flo, and thatâ€™s it.

Standing at the sink during the processing steps is meditative. I can stand there and just let my mind wander. Itâ€™s usually silent, but sometimes I have music playing. And thereâ€™s nothing like seeing the images unfurl when taking the roll off the reel. Magic.

Scanning, on the other hand, is ????.
