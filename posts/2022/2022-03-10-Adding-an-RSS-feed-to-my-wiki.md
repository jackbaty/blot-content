# Adding an RSS feed to my wiki

[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is a single static HTML file. It does not generate an RSS feed of new entries. It doesn‚Äôt _generate_ anything.

I treat my wiki at [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml) more like a blog than a wiki, so not having an RSS feed feels like an omission. Most of the time I consider this to be a feature. I like that I can write any old nonsense and it doesn‚Äôt actively go out and bother anyone. It‚Äôs my little secret, that you can read if you want.

On the other hand, I find it annoying when I‚Äôm interested in someone else‚Äôs writing and they don‚Äôt provide any feeds. So, I‚Äôve decided to make it easier to follow me. I suppose if you deliberately subscribe to the wiki‚Äôs feed, you _want_ to be bothered by the stuff I write there.

My solution is based on [this article](https://radar231.com/RSS%2520Feed%2520for%2520Tiddlywiki%2520SSG%2520Website.html) . The short version is that I created a new tiddler named ‚ÄúRSS Feed‚Äù containing the following:

This tiddler runs a filter finding the last 10 tiddlers tagged with `Feed` and renders them as RSS-formatted XML.

Extracting the rendered text from that tiddler out to an RSS file is done using my Makefile using the [TiddlyWiki node.js module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiddlywiki) . The command is as follows:

`tiddlywiki --load index.html --render "&#91;&#91;RSS Feed]]" "rss.xml" text/plain`

This generates a file at ./output/rss.xml containing the rendered RSS text/xml. Later in the Makefile, I rsync rss.xml up to the server along with the rest of the wiki files. Here‚Äôs the complete Makefile:

    SERVER_HOST=server01.baty.net
    SERVER_DIR=/home/jbaty/apps/rudimentarylathe.wiki/public_html
    PUBLIC_DIR=~/Sync/wikis/rudimentarylathe/
    TARGET=server01.baty.net
    
    .POSIX:
    .PHONY: checkpoint deploy
    
    build:
            tiddlywiki --load index.html --render "&#91;&#91;RSS Feed]]" "rss.xml" text/plain
    
    checkpoint:
            git add .
            git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit -m "Publish checkpoint"
    
    deploy: build checkpoint
            git push
            @echo "33&#91;0;32mDeploying updates to $(TARGET)...33&#91;0m"
            rsync -v -rz --checksum --delete --no-perms $(PUBLIC_DIR)index.html $(SERVER_HOST):$(SERVER_DIR)
            rsync -v -rz --checksum --delete --no-perms $(PUBLIC_DIR)output/rss.xml $(SERVER_HOST):$(SERVER_DIR)
            rsync -v -rz --checksum --delete --no-perms $(PUBLIC_DIR)files $(SERVER_HOST):$(SERVER_DIR)
    

All this means is that you can now subscribe to the daily posts at [wiki.baty.net](https://wiki.baty.net/) using the following URL: [https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml](https://wiki.baty.net/rss.xml) .

The odd thing is that I normally create each daily post first thing in the morning and update it throughout the day. I‚Äôm not sure how different RSS readers will handle this, but it‚Äôs a start.

I haven‚Äôt added the discovery links yet, but should. I also don‚Äôt think the RSS tiddler needs all those non-breaking spaces so I may play with that later.

**Update March 11, 2022**: Saq Imtiaz sent a link to his [experimental plugin for generating RSS and JSON feeds](https://github.com/saqimtiaz/tw5-feeds) . Worth a look!
