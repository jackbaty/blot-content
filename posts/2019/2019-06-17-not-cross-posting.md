# Meta: No longer automatically cross-posting

I've disabled cross-posting from baty.blog to Micro.blog/Twitter/Mastodon. I like not worrying about force-feeding every single thing I publish to other feeds. If I post something I want to share more widely, I'll post links directly.

This feeling started with [my wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org). I just write stuff there without worrying about where it's going to "go". 

For those few who truly want to read everything, there's [RSS](/feed.rss)
