# Correction (fluid)

I [commented yesterday](/2019/a-coworker-just-came-into-my-office-and-asked-if-i-had-any-wite-out-and-when-i-told-him-i-did-not-he) about being made fun of for not having any Wite-Out (a brand of correction fluid) because ha-ha you're old and the only person left using paper.

I assumed that the market for things like correction fluid must be nearly non-existent.

[Not true](https://qz.com/emails/quartz-obsession/1602273/), says today's edition of Quartz Obsession.
