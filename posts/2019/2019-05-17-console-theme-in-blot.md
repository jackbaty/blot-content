I've switched back to Blot's "Console" theme for
[baty.blog](). My thinking is that this better
reflects its more technical bent, now that I'm posting non-tech things
over at [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com).

UPDATE (2019-05-28): As wonderfully nerdy as it is, "Console" is hard on the eyes. Trying "Rosa".
