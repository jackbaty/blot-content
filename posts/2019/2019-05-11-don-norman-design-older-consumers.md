# Don Norman on how design fails older consumers

[Don Norman, Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me):

> The designers at Apple apparently believe that text is ugly, so it should either be eliminated entirely or made as invisible as possible. ... Today, Appleâ€™s products violate all the fundamental rules of design for understanding and usability, many of which Tognazzini and I[^employees] had helped develop. As a result, even a manual is not enough: all the arbitrary gestures that control tablets, phones, and computers have to be memorized. Everything has to be memorized.

It's not just a problem for the elderly, either.

[^employees]: Both Norman and Tognazzini were formerly employees of Apple and are very much worth listening to.
