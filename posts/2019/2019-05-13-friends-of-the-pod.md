# Friends of the Pod (N+1)



[N+1](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-34/the-intellectual-situation/friends-of-the-pod/):

> Actually, hell is other fans — specifically, fans of podcasts we don’t listen to. People give each other recommendations, barely better than the algorithm’s, and describe it as “discovery.” “You *have* to check out *Pod Save America*,” we hear a journalism student say to a barista. A rookie error, to admit to not listening; once you do, you’ve brought the proselytizing upon yourself. By now we have learned to lie, just like we learned to lie about watching *Six Feet Under*. Of course we love *99% Invisible*! That episode about the artists squatting in a room accidentally built into the mall? So good. Back when we were honest, we suffered more.

> Talk radio can still control the listener’s emotional response, but no one feels threatened by the infinitely banal podcast. Instead of emotion or camaraderie, what podcasts produce is chumminess — reminiscent of the bourgeois club atmosphere, reconfigured as the desperate friendliness of burned-out knowledge workers.
