# Intertwingling the TiddlyWiki

"Intertwingling the TiddlyWiki" is a fascinating talk by [Jeremy Ruston](https://jermolene.com/) (author of [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com)), and [Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/) (author of [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)) about the design of software like TiddlyWiki and how useful it could be if separate wikis could "talk" to each other. It's a take on [federation](https://indieweb.org/federation) and also hits on ideas behind creating a [Zettelkasten](https://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html).

Jeremy's bit starts at around 16:30.
