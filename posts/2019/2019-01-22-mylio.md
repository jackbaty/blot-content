# Mylio as a photo organizer

I received a nice email today from someone who'd seen my [recent post about Lightroom CC](/2019/struggling-with-lightroom-cc) and recommended [Mylio](https://mylio.com/) for managing my photo library.

I'd never heard of Mylio, but their approach looks interesting.

> Mylio is not a cloud service, so it doesnâ€™t rely on the internet to sync or view your files. Your memories are available directly on your device anywhere, anytime

and also...

> Sync thousands of files to your devices using a fraction of the space. You can then free up space on your device without losing access to your files.

If you've used Mylio, I'd like to hear about your experience with it.
