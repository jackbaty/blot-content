# How did journalists file before Google Docs? (CJR)



[Amanda Darrach, CJR](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/journalist-file-deadline-article.php):

> By the summer of 1863, competition was fierce. A *New York Tribune* reporter was about 10 miles from Gettysburg, trying to cover a cavalry raid, when the battle opened. The town’s telegraph operator told him the wires had been cut. “The Trib’s man gathered up a work crew, rented a handcar from the president of the railroad, and took off to find the break and repair it,” Tucher says. “In return, he demanded that the telegraph operator not let anyone else but him use the wire, and sent off a scoop.”
