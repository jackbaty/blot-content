# Introducing MAYA: the incredible modern digital darkroom timer

![](/_img/2019/2019-02-16-maya-timer.png)

> [MAYA](https://igg.me/at/darkroomtimer) is a brand new, modular, from scratch digital darkroom timer that can be used (right now) for both making prints and timing film/paper development.

I'll be getting one of these the minute it's available (and also when I've finished my darkroom).
