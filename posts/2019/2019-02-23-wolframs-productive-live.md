# Seeking the productive life - Stephen Wolfram

[Stephen Wolfram](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/):

> Often Iâ€™ll do a meeting where I have lots of people in case we need to get their input. But for most of the meeting I donâ€™t need all of them to be paying attention (and Iâ€™m happy if theyâ€™re getting other work done). But if video is on, seeing people who are not paying attention just seems to viscerally kill the mood of almost any meeting.

Wolfram goes into great detail about his process and systems. He takes things _way_ farther than I would dream of. It's long and fascinating and I loved reading it. He's kind of my hero now. I actually bought Wolfram's software at one point but it goes mostly over my head.

He has this in his basement:

And also this. Don't you love it?
