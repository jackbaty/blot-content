# Blackwing Natural pencil

I was running low on pencils at work when [@hjertnes](https://micro.blog/hjertnes) told me about the new [Blackwing Naturals](https://blackwing602.com/product/blackwing-natural/).

I find the graphite is too soft in the very popular Blackwing 602s. The Naturals use "extra-firm Japanese graphite" which should be an improvement. I think they look terrific, so I ordered a box.

The downside is that I always cut off those sharp, unwieldy erasers. I'm looking forward to trying the new Naturals.
