# Seeing the music

![Turntable](/_img/2019/2019-05-05_Turntable.jpg)

One of my favorite things about listening to vinyl records is that I
can see the music as it plays. Ok I suppose I can’t exactly “see” it,
but you know what I mean. I like my old reel-to-reel player for the
same reason. Even cassette tapes give me a little of that feeling.
