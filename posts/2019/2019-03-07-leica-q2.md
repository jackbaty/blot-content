# Leica announces the Q2

I bought a used Leica Q a few months ago and it's a fantastic camera. I love almost everything about it.

Leica just announced the Q2 ([Leica Rumors](https://leicarumors.com/2019/03/07/leica-q2-camera-officially-announced.aspx/#more-57077)) and it looks like a great update.

But 47.3 Megapixels? I don't need that kind of resolution, although they did add a 75mm equivalent crop mode which probably leaves enough image to work with after the crop.

I'm not thinking of getting one. Not _only_ because it's priced at $5,000, but because it doesn't offer enough over my current Q. I sure would like the weather sealing though. Oh, and the improved on/off switch. The one on the original is terrible. Maybe in a couple of years.
