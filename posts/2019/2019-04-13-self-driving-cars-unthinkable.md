# Self-driving cars will be considered unthinkable 50 years from now

[Meredith Broussard, Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/27/18194715/self-driving-cars-uber-lyft):

> The simple explanation for why this situation didnâ€™t escalate: the unspoken social contract of the bus driverâ€™s authority in this space. We have invested years in developing social contracts around both private and public transportation. When you get into a bus or a train, or even a car, you acknowledge that the person at the wheel is in charge. This power relationship is what allows shared transportation to flourish, and this social contract is what helps many of us in marginalized groups feel safer while riding transportation. It doesnâ€™t feel safe to imagine riding in a shared driverless vehicle. Not just because the technology doesnâ€™t work â€” but because it doesnâ€™t feel safe to be alone in a small, enclosed space with strange men.

I hadn't thought about that specific problem with self-driving public transportation. Feels important, but I don't see how it condemns _all_ self-driving vehicles. It does make me wonder what else I haven't considered. On the other hand, I believe she's overly defeatist and contrarian on the topic overall[^book]. My prediction is that in 50 years she'll be proven 75% wrong.
