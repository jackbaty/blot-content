# Daily software stack as of June 06, 2019

Because things change, I've jotted down the list of apps I use to manage my "stuff" daily as of today.  Below each is a quick list of the types of things for which it's used. At some point I'd like to go into more detail, but by the time I do that everything changes again. 

The list is longer than I would like, but I can't seem to narrow it down further. The highlight here is that I'm unable to get rid of Emacs, so it remains an important part of my process. I fear that it always will, and that I'll [have to get good at it, eventually](https://www.baty.blog/2019/i-should-just-get-really-good-at-emacs).

## Emacs

- Task management via org-mode
- Long-form journaling via org-journal
- Time tracking
- Document production
- Too much of my spare time

## TheBrain

- The Control Center: Connects everything to everything
- Project management
- CRM
- Personal and work event timelines
- Links to interesting things and to their concepts

## Tinderbox

- Project notes
- Logs
- Visual/Concept mapping

## Day One

- Photo/event journaling

## Drafts

- My note-taking "inbox"
- Blog posts, tech notes, and ideas percolate here until ready to be moved somewhere more permanent

## Apple Notes

- For finished notes that I may want to share or access quickly on the go

## DEVONthink

- Document archive

## BBEdit

- All sorts of wierd text processing
- Occasionally as a writing environment

## Typora

- Markdown writing. Mostly blog posts. I just really like writing here.
