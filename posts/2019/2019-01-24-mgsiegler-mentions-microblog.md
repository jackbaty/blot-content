# M.G. Siegler micro.blog mention

[M.G. Siegler, First Draft #150](http://newsletter.mgsiegler.com/issues/tumblr-too-155321):

> It’s weird. If you wanted to start something as simple as a link blog these days, there’s no good way to do it. Sure, you could set up a WordPress site, but it will undoubtedly be overkill. Medium has gone in another direction. And other things such as the newer Micro.blog are almost too predicated around mobile and simplicity. There’s just no good way to do what you could do on Tumblr.

 I read M.G. Siegler because he's interesting, even though I don't always agree with his take on things. In his latest newsletter, he laments the downfall of Tumblr. I'm confused by his near-dismissal of [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) here. He starts with wanting "...something as simple as starting a link blog..." but then shrugs off Micro.blog as too simple. I agree that Micro.blog isn't a direct replacement for Tumblr, but if one wanted to start a new link blog today, Micro.blog would be a damn fine way to do that.
 
Update Jan 25. In his [subsequent blog post](https://500ish.com/tumblr-too-929b7d359221), Siegler changed the Micro.blog sentence to read "And other things such as the newer Micro.blog are almost too spartan." (via [@kordumb](https://micro.blog/kordumb))
