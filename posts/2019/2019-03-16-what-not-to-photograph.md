# What not to photograph

Whenever I need a reminder of what types of photographs I'd like avoid making, I pay a visit to the [popular page on 500px](https://500px.com/popular).

To sum up...

- Long exposures of water
- Star trails
- Over-processed semi-nudes of impossible women
- Flowers
- Bokeh for the sake of bokeh
- Birds (eagles especially), also insect macros
- HDRs of _anything_

These can all make for lovely photographs, and I'm guilty of all of them, but they're just not my style.
