# What might I use Craft for?


[Kevin asks](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Variably_Distressed/page/01-08-2021), ‚ÄúI'm curious to know what kind of stuff you are tinkering with in Craft Editor?‚Äù. Good question, but I don‚Äôt have a great answer yet.

The short version is, not much. 

[Craft](https://www.craft.do) is a new-ish notetaking app for the Mac and iOS. It's quite pretty and rather fancy. I of course try every new app for notes, so I have been playing with Craft for a couple of weeks.

Craft immediately reminded me of [Notion.so](https://notion.so), but I don't like using Notion, so I dismissed it at first. After tinkering a bit, I grew to see it as a simpler, faster tool than Notion. It seemed to include the useful bits without all the hoo-ha of Notion.

So how might I use it? Well it‚Äôs certainly not going to be a replacement for [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

Roam has transformed the way I keep records and take notes. None of its competitors have tempted me away for any length of time. 

- [Obsidian: A knowledge base that works on local Markdown files.](https://obsidian.md/)
- [RemNote ‚Äì Your Thinking and Learning Workspace.](https://www.remnote.io/)
- [LogSeq, A local-first knowledge base.](https://logseq.com/)

I remain all-in with Roam for my daily notes.

Then, there's [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

For a few years I used Emacs for everything. Too many things, if I‚Äôm honest. Today I‚Äôm down to using it for notes on certain projects and for document creation. I'd like to move away from Emacs eventually.

I love LaTeX and Org-mode, but man, what a pain it all is to get right. I tweak and I tweak and I tweak. Personally, I love the way LaTeX renders and typesets documents. The people I share those documents with are less enthusiastic. I get, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just send me a Google Doc?‚Äù a lot. No, I can‚Äôt send you a Google Doc. I don‚Äôt like Google or its Docs, so Craft could be a good option for the document creation tasks I now use Emacs for.

Craft makes it easy to create and share good-looking and easy-to-use documents, so **to answer Kevin‚Äôs question, I‚Äôm considering Craft for creating documents I intend to share**. I don‚Äôt know yet if that will be worth paying for, but it‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed.

(I also [posted this as a Craft document](https://www.craft.do/s/EGpE92c2wi93H0), but I've copied it here in case I delete my account.)
