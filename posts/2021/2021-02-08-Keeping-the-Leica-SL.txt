# Keeping the Leica SL

I was supposed to sell the Leica SL once the SL2-S arrived. I almost did it, too. It‚Äôs technically still listed for sale in a couple of places, but I‚Äôm not ready to get rid of it yet. I mean just look at it.

The Leica SL is five years old and still a wonderful camera. If I‚Äôm being honest, the brand new SL2-S is better, but not _that_ much better. I‚Äôm keeping the original because it‚Äôs awesome and it‚Äôs worth more to me to have around than the money I could get for it. This calculus could change, of course, but it‚Äôs kind of amazing that I have an _extra_ SL available. I don‚Äôt see the APO-Summicron-SL 35mm ever coming off the SL2-S, so it‚Äôs great that I can keep one of the M primes or the Zoom lens on the SL without having to switch lenses.

Another benefit of keeping the SL is that I can take it places I might not take the newer one. It seems silly to call the SL my ‚Äúbeater‚Äù camera but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm thinking of it. If I drop or lose or have the SL2-S and Summicron stolen, I‚Äôm out a very significant amount of money. With the SL and cheaper lens it would still really hurt, but less. The SL has GPS built in and the SL2-S does not, which is handy for if and when I actually do go places again.

I no longer have a camera to use for [scanning film](__GHOST_URL__/2020/using-the-skier-sunray-copy-box-3-for-digital-film-scanning/) , since I sold all my Fuji gear. I‚Äôm thinking about finding a cheap Nikkor macro and adapter and using the SL for the scanning station. Not an ideal use for such a fine camera, but should work well.

And finally, I get a little emotional about cameras. I sold the M10-P and hate myself for it, even though it was necessary at the time. I‚Äôm thinking that if I don‚Äôt _have_ to sell the SL, why not keep it around for a while?

I have had thoughts about finding a used Leica Monochrom. If I get serious about that I‚Äôd need to sell the SL to help fund the M. In the meantime, the SL won‚Äôt go to waste.

**UPDATE** (February 24, 2021): I sold the SL. Could not resist trying a Q2 Monochrom.
