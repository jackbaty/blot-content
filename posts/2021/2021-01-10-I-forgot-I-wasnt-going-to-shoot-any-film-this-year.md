# I forgot I wasn't going to shoot any film this year

Itâ€™s not that I made a _promise_ or anything, but I had no intention of shooting film in 2021. I put away my scanning rig, stored the chemicals, and placed the cameras on a shelf.

Iâ€™ve been so excited by the new Leica SL2-S that I figured Iâ€™d just spend my time with that camera for a while. You know how I am, though. I picked up the M6 and saw that it was loaded with film and couldnâ€™t help myself. That camera just _begs_ to be used, once you touch it.

Anyway, I made a few mirror self-portraits, annoyed the dog, and documented the state of my desk. The usual mundane stuff one shoots when bored and holding a camera during a pandemic in winter.

I finished the roll of Tri-X, shot at ISO 800, and processed it in HC-110. I love HC-110 because it lasts forever on the shelf, and is easy to mix and use. Iâ€™m no longer experimenting with various developers and processes. They all look basically the same to me, and HC-110 is cheap and easy.

It remains to be seen how much film I shoot, but Iâ€™ve dusted off the gear and Iâ€™m ready for whenever the mood strikes.
