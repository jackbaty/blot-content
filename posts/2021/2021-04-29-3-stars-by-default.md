# ★★★ 3 stars by default

Here’s my star rating system for everything:

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Loved it!  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ It was good  
⭐️⭐️⭐️ It was OK  
⭐️⭐️ I didn’t like it  
⭐️ Hated it

With me, everything gets 3 stars by default. Books, movies, photographs, everything: 3 stars right off the bat. I always assume that this new thing or person or conversation will be OK at the very least. This applies to more than just media. It applies to people, too. Sometimes I’m disappointed and end up with 1 or 2 stars, but more often than not I’m surprised and delighted and my opinion of something or someone goes up rather than down.

Too many people seem to start out assuming everything and everyone only deserve 1 or 2 stars. They expect to dislike everything by default. This doesn’t seem healthy to me. Why go out of your way to look for trouble?
