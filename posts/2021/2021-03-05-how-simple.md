# How simple can it get? 

I'm so tempted to make another attempt at living in a Web Browser, Emacs, and the Filesystem. I've failed before, but I keep thinking about this quote from Thomas Paine...

> ...the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered; and the easier repaired when disordered

What I'm unsure of is whether anything involving Emacs can ever be "simple".
