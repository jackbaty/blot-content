# Selling cameras is usually a mistake

Iâ€™ve owned a lot of cameras and lenses.

[More than average](https://wiki.baty.net/#Cameras), Iâ€™d say. Iâ€™ve of course sold more than I currently own. With few exceptions, I regret selling any of them.

Remember how the Nikon F6 printed exposure data between frames?

Or how nice it was having aperture-priority auto-exposure on the Leica M7?

Or the Mamiya 6 with its giant square negatives in an easy-to-shoot package?

Iâ€™ve been thinking about this lately while pondering all of the money I have tied up in various cameras and how infrequently I use some of them. My head tells me to sell everything Iâ€™m not using often, but my heart wonâ€™t let me. I always, _always_ regret selling camera gear, so I think Iâ€™ll hang onto all of it for now. At least until circumstances dictate that I cannot.
