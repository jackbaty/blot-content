# Dusting off the Olympus Stylus Epic

![](/_img/2021/2021-06-16-Olympus-Stylus-Epic-R0001269.jpg)

I [bought my first Olympus Stylus Epic in 2004](https://archive.baty.net/2004/olympus-stylus-epic/) and fell in love. Iâ€™ve owned one ever since. That original copy was [replaced in 2012](https://archive.baty.net/2012/201211replacing-my-olympus-stylus-epic/) for $10, in the box, from a guy on Craigslist. Those days are gone. These little fellas have grown quite a following and fetch upwards of $300 on eBay. Iâ€™m not going to be paying that much once this one dies.

Mine has been collecting dust in a drawer for a year or two, which is a shame, so took it out today and loaded it with a roll of HP5+. No sense trying to preserve it, right?
