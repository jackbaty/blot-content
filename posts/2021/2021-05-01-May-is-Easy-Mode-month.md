# May is "Easy Mode" month

![](/_img/2021/APC_0001.jpg)

I’m exhausted. I think it’s because I haven’t been working in more than a month and my brain has had too much free time to “figure stuff out.” (Yes, I know how it sounds to complain about exhaustion while not having a job!)

As an experiment, I’m going to live the month of May in “Easy Mode”. This means I’m going to solve problems with quick, obvious, _easy_ solutions. I’m going to use the easy-to-use tools. And I’m going to make various processes as easy as possible.

Examples? Sure!

*   Roam not Emacs
*   Lightroom CC not Photo Mechanic and Capture One
*   Things not Org mode
*   Day One not Org Journal
*   WordPress not Hugo
*   Streaming music not FLAC/MP3 files
*   Netflix not Plex
*   Books not Kindle
*   Walks not Workouts
*   Mac not Linux

It could be argued that some of these are backwards, but this is where I’m starting, and the gist is: nothing fancy for a while.
