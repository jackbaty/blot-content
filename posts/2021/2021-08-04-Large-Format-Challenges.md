# Large Format: Challenges

![](/_img/2021/img20210804_09080776.jpg)

There are too many things that can go wrong when shooting large format (4Ã—5) film.

I made four exposures of my friends Steve and Bryan this afternoon. Two of the four were ruined right off the bat: The first, because Iâ€™d left the shutter open when pulling the dark slide. The second because I didnâ€™t expose it at all and processed as though I had.

Large format is hard.

There are so many opportunities to fail that making a successful image is really quite rewarding. Today wasnâ€™t a rewarding day. Both of the photos that werenâ€™t completely ruined were spoiled in other ways.

The above image was taken while facing into the sun. That was dumb. I was so flustered after accidentally exposing the first negative that I basically ignored the actual subject of the shot.

And the following image shows some blooming/flair around the overexposed decking and table areas. Iâ€™m not sure why itâ€™s so severe. The lens may have been dirty.

Oh well, Iâ€™ll just need to keep practicing because when it works, itâ€™s awesome.
