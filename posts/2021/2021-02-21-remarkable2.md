# A Remarkable Tablet

![](/_img/2021/2021-02-21-remarkable2-preview.jpg)

You'll find a paper notebook near me most of the time. Writing on paper helps me remember things better than typing notes into an app on a computer. Because I'm a visual thinker, writing on paper helps me find things later. I tend to remember, spacially, where I write things; as in, "It's in the lower left corner toward the front." 

I thought Apple's iPad and Pencil would be ideal for taking notes. They aren't. The combination of iPad and Pencil is an amazing bit of technology, but using an iPad as a notebook sucks. Writing on an iPad feels like using a somewhat clumsy input device through glass onto a computer. I tried the screen covers that are supposed to make writing on an iPad feel more like paper. They donâ€™t. And worse, the rest of the iPad's features (along with the entire internet) are always right there, lurking behind the glass, waiting to distract me.

The [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/) is billed as "the only tablet that feels like paper," so I was of course intrigued. Skeptical, but curious. I wondered if it could really replace my paper notebooks even after the iPad failed.

Turns out that, yes, it can.

I love the reMarkable tablet, and here's why.

**It really does feel a lot like paper**. The first time I wrote on it I was like, "Woah, that's nice!" It's enough like paper that I'm not distracted by how it feels.

**I love the hardware**. The device looks and feels great. Solid. It's as thin as a half-used legal pad.  The pen is light but not too light. And speaking of the pen, I bought the fancy one with an "eraser". The eraser takes a minute to get used to, but is exactly the right thing. The pen doesn't use a battery, so there's never that fear of not being able to write because I forgot to charge it.

**I love the look of the screen.** It looks like paper. There's no backlight, which many consider a missing feature. I don't. It's very easy on the eyes. It's cool that I can choose the type of "paper". No more fretting about which type of notebook to buy. Should I choose lined paper or do I go with a dot grid pattern? Doesn't matter, now I can have all of them any time I want.

**Battery life is great**. The battery lasts long enough so that I'm not always thinking about the battery. I charged mine a couple days ago and it's now at 87%. 

**It's always ready.** Using an iPad for writing is acceptable if I'm specifically sitting down to write for a while, but it's less useful for general note taking. The reMarkable is always ready. I have mine set to sleep after 20 minutes. If it does happen to fall asleep while I'm thinking or doing something else, I just tap the button at the top left and it's ready to go in less than a second. The iPad, on the other hand, needs to sleep much sooner if I want the battery to last through a couple of meetings. And when the iPad does fall asleep (as it always does) I have to tap to wake, then swipe up, then lean over so FaceID works (and it often doesn't, so then I must also enter my pass code). This makes the iPad an unacceptable replacement for paper. The always-ready feeling of the reMarkable might be the most meaningful difference between it and the iPad. It's not as ready as paper, but it's close.

**I love the lack of features.** What I love most about the reMarkable tablet is what it _doesn't_ do, which is just about everything. There's nothing else there[^nothing]. I can write and organize notes and sketches. That's it. There's nothing lurking behind a swipe or a notification. If I want, I can see all my notes on the companion apps on my Mac and iOS devices. I can convert my handwriting to text and email it to myself. That's how I wrote this post, in fact. It worked great.

Many of the reviews I've read have focused on all the features that the reMarkable 2 doesn't have. They miss the fact that those missing features are the greatest _feature_ of the reMarkable. The reMarkable tablet is not much more than a stack of flexible notebooks, and that's all I wanted.

[^nothing]: Well, I can read and write on PDFs but that is likely something I will only occasionally do.
