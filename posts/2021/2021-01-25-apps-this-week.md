# Apps I'm using this week

**simple [ sim-puhl ]**, adj. Having few parts or features; not complicated or elaborate.

I talk a big game about keeping things simple, but I rarely follow my own advice.

Before restarting my computer, I usually quit all open apps. This morning I noticed how many that was. I didn't count them, but it was a metric shit-ton of apps. And there was a lot of feature overlap.

So today I made a few changes to the lineup, spurred on by a desire to reduce the number of apps I need open and to consolidate where things are kept. You know, I wanted to keep it simple. ðŸ˜†

Here's what changed.

- **[OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)** for tasks. I had tasks everywhere (Curio, Emacs, paper notebooks, Things, Reminders, Roam, etc.) That all happened organically, but is unsustainable and crazy-making. At first I thought I'd move it all into Things again, but when there's lots going on, OmniFocus is the appropriate answer, so I took the opportunity to start with an empty database and migrated _everything_ I'm supposed to do from the other places into OmniFocus.
- **[TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com)** for projects. I've been trying to keep work stuff out of my Roam database, and had been using a combination of Org mode and Curio and DEVONthink. I've bailed on both Org mode and Curio and put it all into TheBrain. TheBrain version 12 does a great job with notes and backlinks and of course links everything to everything. Giving it a go for project and people management.
- **[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com)** for journaling and daybook. I'd been journaling in Org mode and Day One and sometimes Roam. No more. If I want to write about either the large swaths of my day or the minutiae, it goes in Day One. I keep a few separate journals in Day One. The big ones are Journal for photos and general journaling and Daybook for the minutiae about the day.
- **[Roam](https://roamresearch.com)** is for topic journals. I've been limiting my use of Roam to mostly things I want to learn about or take notes on. Quotes, links, ideas, etc. Roam is good at that.
- **[Nova](https://www.nova.app)** for writing and editing. For manipulating text, there's nothing like BBEdit, but what I do with text most often is write and edit Markdown files. For this, I'm using Nova, from Panic. It's just nicer for that sort of work.

I'm writing it down because it's fun seeing how things evolve. It remains to be seen if I need to write a new post _next_ week about this.
