# Betting long on film with a new Leica MP

![](/_img/2021/leicamp-boxed.jpg)

I enjoy both film and digital photography, but the pendulum has been swinging toward film recently, and I‚Äôve been having a ball.

I‚Äôve finally dialed in a film processing, scanning, and editing workflow that works and that I don‚Äôt hate. What‚Äôs more, I‚Äôve been studying my recent film photos and I really like them. I like that they‚Äôre not so perfect that zooming in to 100% is useful. I like the defects and unpredictability. I like the process. But most of all, I like the cameras. Specifically, I like Leica rangefinders.

I bought my first Leica M, an M6 TTL back in 2004. From there I‚Äôve had an M3, M4, M6, M7, M8, and M10-P. Eventually, I ended up with a comfortable kit with an M3, M4, and M6 Classic. The M3 is great because it‚Äôs the first M, and the .92x finder magnification is perfect for 50mm lenses and makes shooting 90mm lenses feasible. The M4 is a more modern, but still entirely mechanical, non-metered body. And the M6 Classic is newer (still 20+ years old) and is metered.

Each of the M cameras was purchased used (of course). Their resale value has gone through the roof over the past few years. Clean M6 bodies go for twice what I paid for mine. Leica film cameras may not qualify as ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù but they certainly don‚Äôt depreciate. At least they haven‚Äôt since I‚Äôve owned them.

What I‚Äôve never done is buy a brand new Leica M film camera, because that would be crazy. Why buy new when I can get something for a third of the price that works great and does basically the same thing? And unlike used bodies, new cameras _do_depreciate. At least for a minute.

But I must admit to always dreaming of a brand new Leica M film camera. Leica only makes two: The [non-metered M-A](https://leicacamerausa.com/m-a-typ-127-black.html) and the [metered MP](https://leicacamerausa.com/mp-0-72-black.html) .

Leica recently announced a special black-paint version of the digital M10-R and [I thought it looked beautiful](/2021/black-paint-leica-m10-r-beautiful/). It got me thinking about other black paint Leica bodies and how much I love that finish. Several of the older models were available with the gorgeous black paint finish, but they fetch even higher prices than the regular chrome and black chrome models.

I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it and started poking around and learned that the MP happens to be available in black paint. Whaddaya know? Of course they‚Äôre always backordered everywhere and I was told the wait time was in _months_. So much for an impulse purchase. Whew!

So for a few days I put a few rolls through the M3 and M6 and was reminded how much fun it could be. But wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to be the original owner of a new Leica M? I‚Äôve been told by people who know me and have been around me that I should ‚ÄúNever sell a Leica!‚Äù. What better way to make sure that happens than to have a new one I can call my own forever?

And the rationalizations continued for a week or so while I absorbed every review, forum post, and YouTube video I could find that contained even a whiff of information about the MP.

I love film. I want to always shoot film. So I called [Leica Store Miami](https://leicastoremiami.com/) and put myself on the waiting list for a black paint MP. I was told they only receive new ones every couple of months, and the waiting list is pretty long, so I should settle in for a long wait. And who knows, maybe I‚Äôd lose interest in the meantime. It happens. Of course B&H, Leica, and the other usual outlets were backordered as well.

Then, on a whim, I looked for one at [Camera West](https://www.camerawest.com/) . I‚Äôve purchased from them before and had good luck. You know what happens next, right? They had 2 new black paint MPs in stock. I bought one immediately.

So that happened.

The camera arrived today and I‚Äôve never seen anything so beautiful. It‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs new, warrantied, flawless, and mine. My long bet on film begins today.
