# A visual thinker using text-based tools

Yesterday I was asked something about a project Iâ€™d worked on two years ago. At that time Iâ€™d used [Curio](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/) to help manage the project. I opened the Curio project and within thirty seconds of just looking at the workspace I had a handle on the project and easily found an answer to the questions Iâ€™d been asked.

Whenever I revisit something that Iâ€™d created in [TheBrain](https://thebrain.com/) or a mind map or Curio or [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) , I find the spatial layout of the information to be instantly useful.

And yet I use [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) in Emacs for nearly everything. You can probably tell that Iâ€™m having another one of my moments.

I love plain text. Or maybe itâ€™s more accurate to say that I love the _idea_ of plain text. Nearly all the arguments for using plain text are good arguments, but that doesnâ€™t make plain text any more _useful_ for me.

Plain textâ€™s usefulness depends on what itâ€™s _for_. As an example, a simple log of things that happen throughout the day makes sense as plain text. Itâ€™s almost always going to be accessed via search, and text is made for searching. Journaling can be done in plain text, although itâ€™s made better by including images.

The way text is presented can make all the difference. An example is the display of backlinks in Roam and Logseq. Those tools use a nicely-formatted display, including context. Compare it to something like org-roam, which, as powerful as it is, canâ€™t compete visually. Itâ€™s hard to parse backlinks in org-roam just by looking at them. And thatâ€™s a problem system wide. A wall of text is less useful than a purposefully-arranged and formatted visual display of that same information.

Anyway, I launched Curio and Tinderbox and TheBrain and now Iâ€™m in big trouble.
