# Tools and Toys

Ron was referring to my still-forming opinions about the reMarkable tablet, but he could be referring to any number of things. I have a reputation for frequently changing up my process/tools/systems/workflows/what-have-you. This reputation is not unfounded, but for some reason I feel the need to explain (defend?) myself.

Or perhaps it‚Äôs easier to describe what I‚Äôm _not_ doing:

> **I am not looking for the perfect tool or system. I simply like to try new things.**

Many people seem to assume that I‚Äôm wasting time constantly searching for some better, more-perfect solution. I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs it at all. I‚Äôm not wasting my time, I‚Äôm having fun!

Let‚Äôs look at note-taking and cameras as two good examples.

I don‚Äôt need any new note-taking tools. I don‚Äôt need a different process for taking notes. I don‚Äôt need to take ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù notes. Note-taking is a solved problem. If I want to write something down, I open a text file and write it down. Now, that could be done using Vim or BBEdit or Emacs or whatever. Doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as what I‚Äôve written is in a text file and I can find it later if needed. This would be different if I was an academic or an author working on a novel, but I‚Äôm neither of those.

However, I‚Äôm fascinated by how other people do things and the tools they use. I love seeing how different tools solve different problems for different people. I love _novelty_. This is why I started using Vim in the early 2000s when BBEdit worked just fine. I‚Äôd heard so many people rave about modal editing with Vim that I had to try it. Turns out they were right. Modal editing has informed nearly every text-editing decision since I learned it. One can‚Äôt dig into Vim without also hearing about how great Emacs is. I tried and failed to get into Emacs a few times, but then Spacemacs came along and made it easy for Vim users to adapt. Then Doom replaced Spacemacs because it was simpler and faster. And one can‚Äôt use Emacs without running into Org mode. Then Roam showed up and made automatic backlinks a thing, and I loved that. I still do. In fact, I still enjoy using all of them: BBEdit, Roam, Vim, Emacs, Craft, Obsidian, Logseq, Mem, iA Writer, Ulysses, and on and on. Hell, I still use paper about half the time.

It‚Äôs the same with cameras. I want to experience them all; big, small, cheap, expensive, old, new‚Ä¶all of them. I have or have had some of the (objectively) ‚Äúbest‚Äù cameras ever made. (And no, the best camera is not the one you have with you if what you have with you is a shitty camera.) I don‚Äôt make photographs for a living, so it‚Äôs incorrect to describe a camera as ‚Äújust a tool.‚Äù For me, cameras are toys! Sure, I look for the ones that work well with the way I like to take pictures, but they all have good and bad qualities. I like trying cameras with varying combinations of those qualities.

This all happens because I want to try the things I read about. If someone writes passionately about something they use, whether it be software, hardware, or process, I want to try it for myself.

But let‚Äôs be clear, I don‚Äôt _need_ any of it beyond a basic text editor and, say, my iPhone.

All this stuff is like a giant toy box. And much like Andy in Toy Story, sometimes I find a new favorite toy. This means that old favorites get left in the box for a time. Then one day I re-discover an old favorite and out it comes. There need not be anything ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù about it.
