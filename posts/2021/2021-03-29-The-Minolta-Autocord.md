# The Minolta Autocord

Iâ€™ve had this Minolta Autocord for so long I donâ€™t remember where I got it. Or when, exactly.

Mine is a model RG-2 from 1962 with the Optiper-MVL shutter. I donâ€™t know much else about the camera other than itâ€™s fun but challenging to use. I keep thinking about taking it out for a spin but havenâ€™t done that in a few years.

Thereâ€™s more info about the Autocord at [camera-wiki.org](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Minolta_Autocord)

Hereâ€™s an example from the camera. Itâ€™s me trying a self-portrait while wearing Mario jammies of course.

And then thereâ€™s this crazy thingâ€¦
