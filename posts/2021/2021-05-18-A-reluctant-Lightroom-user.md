# A reluctant Lightroom user

Iâ€™ve never loved editing photos in [Adobeâ€™s Lightroom (Classic)](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) . It does the job fine, and it has all the tools one might need, but itâ€™s no _fun_. I prefer editing with [Capture One Pro](https://www.captureone.com/en) .

As much as I enjoy the editing process in Capture One, it otherwise feels like working on an island. C1 has no way to sync photos, the plugin/extension options are very limited, and while it works with other editors, it doesnâ€™t do it as seamlessly as Lightroom. And so on.

Lightroomâ€™s ecosystem is hard to beat. It works with nearly everything. I can sync with the mobile Lightroom CC library. It works with every plugin one could possibly want (most notably, [Jeffrey Friedlâ€™s](http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies) and [Negative Lab Pro](https://www.negativelabpro.com/) .) Thereâ€™s no end to the presets and styles available. If I want to do something with a photo, Lightroom is more likely to be able to handle it.

Lightroomâ€™s cataloging is more capable than Capture Oneâ€™s. Or at least it feels easier to use. Iâ€™d prefer not having to rely on a specific vendorâ€™s tool for managing my lifetime of photos, but itâ€™s better than only having them scattered in folders. Believe me, Iâ€™ve tried it that way numerous times. Itâ€™s liberating, but only for a moment, then it quickly becomes frustrating.

And of course I donâ€™t like having to pay a monthly subscription to Adobe. That said, for $20 a month I get Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, Lightroom CC on all my devices, and 1TB of cloud storage. Itâ€™s a pretty good deal.

While Iâ€™m still looking for excuses to go back to Capture One, I am, reluctantly, back in Lightroom Classic for the majority of my photo management. For now.
