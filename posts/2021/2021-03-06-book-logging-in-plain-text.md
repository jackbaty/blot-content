# Book logging in plain text

Of all the ways I've logged books, I'm thinking that plain text remains the best. I've been adding books to a text (Markdown) file for while now and it's not pretty, but it works. And it will always work.

I publish a copy at https://books.baty.net.

Like I said, it ain't pretty. On the other hand, I use it regularly by simply running little searches. If I want to know how many books are read in 2020, it's just `grep 2020- books.md | wc -l` and I get `14`. To see the actual books, it's even easier: `grep 2020- books.md` which gives me this:

1. **A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books** by Nicholas A. Basbanes (2020-01-05) | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…
1. **How to Do Nothing** by Jenny Odell (2020-02-05) | â˜…â˜…
1. **The Instructions** by Adam Levin (2020-02-15) | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

1. **Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits (Zoey Ashe, #1)** by David Wong (2020-12-27) | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

Or, how many books have I read by Christopher Moore? `grep 'Christopher Moore' books.md`:

1. **Coyote Blue** by Christopher Moore (1999-01-01)
1. **The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove** by Christopher Moore (1999-01-01)

1. **Noir** by Christopher Moore (2018-05-15)
1. **Shakespeare for Squirrels** by Christopher Moore (2020-06-09) | â˜…â˜…â˜…


It's not perfect, and leaves out any kind of social discovery, so I also enter books in both [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259384-jack-baty) and [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com), which honestly only takes a few minutes per book so it's hardly a burden.

I love that my plain text book log is so lightweight and simple.
