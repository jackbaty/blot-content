# The Penna Bluetooth Keyboard
I was creating an eBay listing to sell my [Penna Bluetooth keyboard](https://www.elretron.com/penna) and I thought I should probably make sure it worked first, since I hadn't used it in months.

The batteries were still good and it paired immediately. I started typing on its [Cherry MX Blue switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Blue) and realized it was so fun and weird and cool-looking that I decided to keep it.
