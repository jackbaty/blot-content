# An Arc browser boost for a better Twitter experience

There are still a few people that I want to hear from that have not (yet) left Twitter, so I visit Twitter maybe once a day. [Andy Bell posted](https://andy-bell.co.uk/how-im-dealing-with-twitter-in-a-hands-off-manner/) the following “Boost” for the [Arc browser](https://arc.net/):

```
[aria-label="Trending"], 
[aria-label="Search and explore"], 
[aria-label="Twitter Blue"],
[data-testid="DMDrawerHeader"], 
[href*="promote"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

It takes about 10 seconds to add new boosts like the above.

I dislike Twitter, but I love Arc. Now Twitter doesn’t suck as much.
