# Barthes on the noise of Time

> For me the noise of Time is not sad: I love bells, clocks, watches â€” and I recall that at first photographic implements were related to techniques of cabinetmaking and the machinery of precision: cameras, in short, were clocks for seeing, and perhaps in me someone very old still hears in the photographic mechanism the living sound of the wood.
