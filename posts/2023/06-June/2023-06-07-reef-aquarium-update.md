# Reef aquarium update

I've had my salt water reef tank for nearly a year, so I thought I'd post an update. The gist is that it's been both easier and more difficult than expected.

It's easier because I was worried that doing water changes and parameter checks would be complex or difficult. They are neither. I do a 15% water change every week, and test for Nitrates, Nitrites, Phosphates, and Calcium every 10 days to two weeks.

It's more difficult because pest control in a salt-water tank can be a bitch! Algae is a constant thorn in my side. I just can't seem to be rid of it. The tank has suffered outbreaks of green hair algae, red slime "algae" (quoted because it's actually [Cyanobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria) and not algae), and now bubble algae. I've also got a little [Aiptasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiptasia) that I'm keeping an eye on.

Everyone talks about a tank's "ugly" phase and now I know what they mean. I think I'm coming to the other side of it, though. Algae is often caused by too many nutrients and/or waste, causing the Phosphate and Nitrate levels to rise. Algae love Phosphates and Nitrates, so the trick is to reduce them. To do this, I've drastically reduced how much food I introduce. After conversations with some experts, it's obvious that I've been over-feeding. The other change I made was to shorten the period during which the tank lighting is at full. I'm now only running full lighting from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. rather than from 10-6. I think I'm finally starting to see the algae weaken and recede.

As for fish, I hadn't added any because of Tony, the Royal Gramma. Tony was an asshole. He was constantly picking on Pierre the Cleaner Shrimp, and I _love_ Pierre. He also flared up and fought with anything new in the tank. Tony was beautiful, but I kicked him out. Messing with Pierre was his last mistake. I gave him to the local fish store so they could re-home him.

With Tony gone and the algae on the decline, it was time to start adding things. This week, I've introduced three new corals: Palythoa Grandis[^toxic], Acan Red, and Green Star Polyps (GSP). I also got a little Emerald Crab. We named him Craig.

Even though it can be frustrating at times, I enjoy the tank very much. It's so much fun to just sit and watch things happening. It's like a whole world in there and it's amazing.


[^toxic]: Apparently, [Palythoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palythoa) can produce a quite deadly toxin (palytoxin) so I'm weighing the pros and cons of keeping it. It's pretty and cool, but yikes.
