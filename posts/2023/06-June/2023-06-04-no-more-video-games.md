# No more video games for me

It’s time to give up on playing video games. It’s not that I waste time playing games, it’s that I waste time trying (and failing) to enjoy playing games. Everyone loves games, so I figure I should too. But I don’t.

I buy every new gaming system that looks fun. Then I read all the reviews on Metacritic and listen to friends rave about the latest Zelda or whatever. Well then, I think, if it’s _that_ good then I should play it! I buy the game, play it for an hour, become frustrated or bored, and never look at it again. This happens every time.

Yesterday, I received a physical copy of “Disco Elysium – The Final Cut” for the Switch, based on many reviews and a recommendation. I played it for less than 20 minutes before becoming bored and knowing I’d never finish it.

I feel like I’m missing out on something great, but at some point I have to admit to myself that I’m just not that into video games and that I should stop trying so hard.
