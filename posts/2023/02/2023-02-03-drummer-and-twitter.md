# Drummer and Twitter

[Dave](http://scripting.com/)‘s blogging tool, [Drummer](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml), will be [affected by Twitter’s API rug pull](http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html).

I’ve maintained (on and off) [a blog using Drummer](http://oldschool.scripting.com/jackbaty/) since its release. Drummer thinks the way I do. Drummer was a direct inspiration for what is now [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/). I basically recreated the parts of Drummer I like but built it using [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) and then later using Eleventy.

I sometimes consider going back to using Drummer, but I hesitate because I worry about it’s long-term viability. Dave’s got a lot of ideas and he doesn’t waste time dealing with the old ones. If Drummer ever becomes an “old idea” then I fear I’ll be left without any support. Dave sometimes struggles with support as it is, but _zero_ is worse than a little.

Anyway, I’ll keep an eye on Dave’s progress and who knows, maybe Drummer will become A Thing for me again.
