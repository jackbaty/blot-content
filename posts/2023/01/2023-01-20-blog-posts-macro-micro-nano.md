# Blog posts: Macro, Micro, (and Nano?)

I remain incapable of consolidating my blogs, social media, etc.

I’m realizing that I have three types of blog posts, “macro”, “micro”, and “nano”.

Normal long-form posts are “macro” posts. Shorter posts or images with commentary are “micro” posts. Then there are the little snippets and random thoughts I can’t help blurting out for some reason. Those are “nano” posts.

I _could_ put them all at [baty.net](https://baty.net/) and be done with it, but I have yet to find a way to do this using WordPress (or Hugo, for that matter). I never like the way themes render all three types.

I thought I could do macro posts at [baty.net](https://baty.net/) and the rest at [jack.micro.blog](https://jack.micro.blog/), but for some reason, I hesitate to post my little nonsense thoughts there because it feels weird having them saved as “real” blog posts. I can’t explain it, but those little “nano” posts make more sense to me on an actual social network like Mastodon.

This morning, I spun up a new Mastodon instance as my “official” social media presence. I wanted my own domain, and [baty.social](https://baty.social/) is as good as any. It’s eponymous, short, and I’d already paid for it a few months ago. So now I’m posting the nano posts at [@jack@baty.social](https://baty.social/@jack).

[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) _can_ act as an account on the Fediverse, but I think I prefer using Mastodon for that.

I’m not sure that there’s a meaningful difference between micro and nano posts, so this is an experiment. If it continues to feel right, great. If not, I’ll try something else.
