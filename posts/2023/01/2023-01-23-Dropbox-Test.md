# Dropbox test - IGNORE 

I haven't been using this blog much recently, but thought I'd check if it still works. It does, but I've recently deleted Dropbox from my Mac, making it cumbersome to update, were I to _want_ to.

I don't like running Dropbox if I don't have to, so I've installed [Maestral](https://maestral.app/), a lightweight Dropbox substitute. If you're reading this, it worked.
