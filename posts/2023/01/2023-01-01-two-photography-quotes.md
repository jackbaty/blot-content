# Two photography quotes

These quotes resonated with me recently, especially the second one, from Alan Burles.

> One must work hard to smuggle anything into a photograph other than record keeping.
> 
> [Erwin Blumenfeld](https://erwinblumenfeld.com/)

> Unless we are having lots of life moments, how can we have any photography moments?
> 
> [Alan Burles](https://www.alanburles.com/)
