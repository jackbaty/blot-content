# Bring back personal blogging

> In the beginning, there were blogs, and they were the original social web. We built community. We found our people. We wrote personally. We wrote frequently. We self-policed, and we linked to each other so that newbies could discover new and good blogs.
> 
> I want to go back there.

Me too! I never left, really, but I would love to read more personal blogs again. Lots more.
