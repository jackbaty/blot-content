# It behooves me, Paul

> If it behooves you, instead of thinking any more about Twitter—hit us with some PDFs, some incomprehensible sociology, a fact about your town, some poetry no one cares about, political theory that will never land, obscure social history, climate links, math things, some tech so obscure 20 people use it. We want your inner noise. Just push the gas on your own ephemeralism and launch us into the future.

I feel like taking Paul’s advice and posting fast and furious on my One True Blog™. I’d like to anoint baty.net as that blog. Hang on.
