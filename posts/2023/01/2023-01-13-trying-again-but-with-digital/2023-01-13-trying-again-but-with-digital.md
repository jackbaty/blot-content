# Trying again but with digital

I took the same walk, but this time I brought a digital camera (Fujifilm X-T5). It’s just not the same. Maybe it’s the 23mm Fuji lens that I don’t love. Or maybe it’s just that I know they’re digital. Whatever it is, I prefer the film shots from the last two outings.
