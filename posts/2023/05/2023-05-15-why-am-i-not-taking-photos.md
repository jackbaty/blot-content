# Why am I not taking photos?

I go through periods during which I don't feel much like making "art" with my cameras. This is normal, but lately I haven't felt like taking photographs at all.

For example, I met my parents yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day. This, being an Eventâ„¢, prompted me to bring my two good cameras, one film and one digital. I wanted to be sure to make a nice record of the day in both formats. In the end, I took a single photo as we left. I took it with my iPhone.
