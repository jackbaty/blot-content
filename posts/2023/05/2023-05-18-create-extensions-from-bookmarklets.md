# Create Arc (Chrome) extensions from bookmarklets

I've been head over heels in love with [Arc](https://arc.net/) for a long time now. So far, the _only_ thing I don't like about it is that there is no support for bookmarklets.

[Convert bookmarklet to Chrome extension](https://sandbox.self.li/bookmarklet-to-extension/) to the rescue.

I've tested it with two bookmarklets so far, and it seems to work fine.
