# Friends (ruby CLI)

[Mike Hall wrote](https://mike.puddingtime.org/posts/2023-05-03-daily-notes/#friends-a-plaintext-ruby-based-prm) about [friends](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn/friends#add-activity), a personal CRM for the command line. It's a ruby gem that does most of the things I was trying to do using Emacs.

It seems worth a try, so I installed the gem and created a few shell aliases to make things faster:

```sh
alias faa 'friends add activity '
alias faf 'friends add friend '
alias fla 'friends list activities'
```
