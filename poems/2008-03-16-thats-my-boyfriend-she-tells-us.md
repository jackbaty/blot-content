# That's my boyfriend! she tells us

"That's my boyfriend!" she tells us  
as the grey-haired man pushes himself  
slowly backward. Using his feet.  
The wheelchair moves more easily that way.  
  
"I think the world of her," he says  
being careful not to move too quickly  
lest he jar his neck brace. (She calls it a "halo.")  
Age amplifying his injuries  
  
Her face, aged 91 years, beams as he says this  
and suddenly looks exactly  
as I imagine it did at age 18  
Kind words will do that  
Those kind in particular  
Especially in this place
