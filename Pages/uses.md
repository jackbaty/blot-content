# What I Use

A list of things that I use to manage my life or that I simply enjoy using.

Last updated **May 2023.** (Still working on it)

## Computer Hardware

* **Apple MacBook Pro M1 Max (2022)** – Finally, Apple makes a great laptop again.
* **Apple iPad Pro 10.9 (2021)** – I am not an iPad person, but this is a great "get-away" device. The Magic Keyboard makes it usable.
* **iPhone 12 Mini** – The properly-sized iPhone. I put it in the Computing category but it fits in nearly every category.
* **[Apple Studio display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/)** – Just the right size. Gorgeous view.
* **Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2015)** – I tinker with Linux on this. I hate the trackpad more than anything.
* **[Synology DS918+](https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DiskStation-Business-Celeron-Operating/dp/B07ZKZLVWH)** - For cold storage and running Plex
* [**Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2**](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb) – The greatest keyboard there is. It's nearly perfect.
* **[Logitech MX Master 3 mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Graphite/dp/B09HM94VDS)** - I still prefer a mouse over a trackpad. This is a good one.


## Software

Here's the software that I currently use on a regular basis.

* **[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)** and  **[Org mode](https://orgmode.org/)** – I write nearly everything in Org-mode. Tasks, lists, documents, publishing, all in plain text. I basically live there.
* [**DEVONthink**](https://devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) – Email Archives, Manuals, PDFs, Scanned documents. Years of archives remain searchable and synced across devices. It's also another way into my ~/org files.
* **Apple Mail** – It's fine, and it's always right there.
* **[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)** – As much as I try to remain in Emacs for editing, whenever I need something fancy done with a lot of text, I turn to BBEdit. It's the editor I've used the longest. In fact, it may be the piece of software I've used the longest, period. It remains truly great.
* [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/) – I have no real need for LaTeX but it does such a great job laying out documents that I use it anyway. Mostly, this is done via Org mode but I also use LaTeX directly when I feel like being tweaky.
* **Terminal** – I spend a lot of time in a terminal. Apple's built-in Terminal app works fine for me, now that I'm using [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/).
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) – For a long time I pushed Mercurial over Git, as it was simpler to use and understand. I lost, so everything goes in Git. 
* [**1Password**](https://1password.com/) – Password management
* [**Arq Backup**](https://www.arqbackup.com/) – Helps me keep things backed up properly
* **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)** – Launcher and generally useful utility for all sorts of automation and shortcuts. Replaced Alfred for me a year or so ago.
* **[Espanso](https://espanso.org/)** - Text expansion utility. It's free, cross-platform, fast, and appropriately nerdy.
* **[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)** — Far and away the best screenshot utility there is
* **Apple Messages** – Nearly everyone I communicate with uses Apple devices
* [**Signal**](https://signal.org/) – For non-Apple and/or private communication


## Services

Web apps/services

* **[Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com)** - Static hosting for most of my websites
* **[Fastmail](https://fastmail.com)** - Personal email
* **[Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en)** - Privacy for browsing
* **[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com)** - Domains and DNS
* **Github** - Repo hosting
* TODO: There's gotta be more, right?


## Photography
### Cameras

* **Leica SL2** (Digital) - Superb build and image quality. Best EVF I've ever used. And made for use with adapted M lenses.
* **Leica MP (Black Paint)** - OMG it's so beautiful. I bought it new in 2021 as my "forever" camera. 
* **Leica M3** - OG Leica M. Built in 1960 and works like butter.
* **Leica IIIf** – Barnack! Mine was made in 1946.
* **Hasselblad 500C/M** - The Hasselblad V series cameras are iconic, beautiful, and superbly engineered. They also produce wonderful images, which is why they are my favorite all-around cameras.
* **Ricoh GRIII** (Digital) - Pocketable, high-quality (APS-C), and fun to use snapshot camera.
* **Graflex Crown Graphic** - Large Format (4×5) film camera. Mine is beat up and held together with gaffer tape, and I love it. It's a pain in the ass to use, but there's nothing like a 4×5 negative.
* **Graflex Speed Graphic** – Another 4×5 film camera. Mine has a bad light leak so it sits on a shelf.
* **Canon AE–1 Program** – 35mm Film SLR. This is the first "real" camera I ever owned.
* **Canon Canonet** – 35mm rangefinder camera. Retired.
* **Canon Pro-zoom 814 Electronic** – Super8 movie film camera
* **Minolta Autocord** – Medium format TLR. Retired.
* **Nikon F100** – 35mm auto-focus film camera. Best bang for the buck in film cameras.
* **Olympus OM–1n** – 35mm film camera. Tiny and jewel-like. Amazing viewfinder.
* **Olympus OM–2n** – 35mm film camera 
* **Olympus Stylus Epic** – Compact 35mm film camera

### Photo Software

* [**Adobe Lightroom Classic**](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) – My primary catalog and photo editor
* [**Capture One Pro**](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx) – Raw file editor for special occasions and tethering
* **Apple Photos** – For iPhone shots and keepers exported from my editor
* [**Photo Mechanic**](https://home.camerabits.com/) – Ingesting, tagging, and renaming photos from cards. Nothing is faster or easier. I'd like to not need it, but trying to caption and tag dozens of photos at a time is an exercise in frustration in any other app.

### Photo Hardware 

Some miscellaneous photo-related support items

* **Canon PRO–100** – Photo printer that I too rarely use
* **Epson V850** – Flatbed film scanner. Works great for medium and large format. Less great for 35mm, but still fine. 
* **Profoto D1 Monolights** – Aging but still great for studio portraits.
* **[Billingham Hadley Pro Small](https://billingham.com/products/hadley-small-pro-camera-bag_colour-sage-fibrenyte-chocolate-leather)** – Beautiful and well-made camera bag

### Darkroom

I use a basement bathroom as a makeshift darkroom.

* [**Leitz Focomat v35**](http://www.bonavolta.ch/hobby/en/photo/v35.htm) – 35mm auto-focus enlarger. Solid and reliable. It is a fantastic device.
* [**Beseler 45MXT**](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/3991-REG/Beseler_8227_45MXT_Enlarger_Chassis_Only.html) – This is for printing medium and large format negatives. Mine is a little janky but works great overall.
* **[Leitz Focomat IIc](https://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/Focomat_IIc)** – Manufactured from 1956–1983, the Focomat IIc is a giant, over-engineered marvel of an enlarger. I bought mine as a fixer-upper from Craigslist and I still don't have it working completely. Getting there, though.

## Lifestyle and Miscellaneous Hardware

### Music Listening
Most of my music equipment was purchased nearly 15 years ago and still works great.

* [**Rega P1 Turntable**](https://www.amazon.com/REGA-Rega-RP1-Turntable-Gray/dp/B004B3GELG) – I love listening to records. I love owning my music and being able to see as well as hear it. I consider the P1 to be a terrific value. Audio people call it a “budget” turntable but I prefer to think of it as a cheap, “high-end” turntable. I've used it nearly every day for almost a decade.
* [**Rega Brio 3 Integrated Amplifier**](https://www.stereophile.com/content/rega-brio-integrated-amplifier-rega-brio-3-march-2007) – Purchased in 2010 to go with P1. It has a good phono stage and still sounds great. I don't feel a need to replace it.
* **[Bluesound Node](https://www.bluesound.com/products/node/)** – Hi-Res music streamer
* [**Roon Optimized Core Kit / NUC**](https://kb.roonlabs.com/Roon_Optimized_Core_Kit) – This is my new favorite thing. It's a tiny computer running the [Roon music software](https://roonlabs.com/) and it's the best way I've ever had to listen to, organize, and discover music.

And the rest…

* **Focal Chorus V Speakers** – Pretty good floor-standing speakers in my TV/Music room.
* **[KEF LSX](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/kef-lsx)** – Outstanding wireless speakers
* **Yamaha CD-S300BL CD Player** – I still listen to CDs, so I bought a new CD player a few years ago.
* **[Sonos wireless music system](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home)** – Music everywhere in my house. I use a Soundbar and several Play:3 speakers.
* **[Sennheiser HD 600](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Open-Back-Professional-Headphone/dp/B00004SY4H)** – Open-back, over-the-ear headphones. These are for when I want to really _listen_ to music.
* **Apple AirPods Max** – They're [amazing but I kind of hate them](https://baty.net/2022/airpods-max-are-amazing-but-i-kind-of-hate-them/)
* **Apple HomePods** – I ended up with a couple of these. They look and sound very good.

### Other

* **Amazon Kindle Oasis** (2nd gen) – Books on the go. I prefer real books but the Kindle sure is handy. I like the larger size of this model.
* **Kobe Forma** ebook reader – An alternative to Amazon that works great with more formats and I can rent books from my local library right from the device.

## Pen and Paper

* [**Leuchtturm 1917 Notebooks**](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Size-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4/) – Better than a Moleskine and perfect for use as a Bullet Journal.
* [**Hobonichi Techo Planner**](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2018/pc/detail_cover/pb18_jan.html) – Best little day planner ever. I've carried one for many years. I sometimes use them only sporadically, but I always come back.
* [**Field Notes**](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) – Always have a Field Notes notebook in my back pocket. It's a better capture tool than the iPhone
* [**Pilot Custom 823**](https://baty.net/2021/pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen/) – My everyday fountain pen. It's nearly perfect
* [**Pelikan Souveran M400**](https://www.amazon.com/Pelikan-Souveran-M400-Black-Fountain/dp/B002MT02DM/) – Beautiful, classic fountain pen. I had the nib tweaked by Richard Binder and it writes like butter. It's for fancy writing.
* **[Mitsu-Bishi Hi-Uni Pencils](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Hi-Uni-Pencils/ct/621)** – I've come around on pencils recently. I find myself reaching for a pencil as often as a pen. More so, maybe.
* [**Caran D'ache Pencil Sharpening Machine**](https://www.amazon.com/Caran-Dache-Pencil-sharpening-Machine-455-200/dp/B0013F5R0Y/) – Overkill, but I love it.
* [**Olympia SM3 Typewriter**](https://typewriterreview.com/2013/02/28/olympia-sm3/) – My favorite typewriter
* [**Olympia SM9 Typewriter**](https://archive.baty.net/2014/olympia-sm9/) – My second favorite typewriter

## Every Day Carry

* [**Tag Heuer Aquaracer Automatic watch**](https://www.tagheuer.com/en-us/watches/aquaracer-calibre-5-automatic-watch-43-mm-way2010-ba0927) – No batteries, beautiful, and good to 300 meters in the water – because that's handy right?
* **Apple Watch (Series 7)** – The health stuff and proper notifications are handy. I wish I could wear this _and_ the Tag.
* **Casio G-Shock(s)** - I have 2 of them. They're great and I can beat them senseless without worry.
* [**Goruck GR1 backpack**](https://www.goruck.com/GR1) – If I ever go outside, I'm ready.
* [**Benchmade Mini Griptilian AXIS Lock Knife**](https://www.amazon.com/Benchmade-Mini-Griptilian-Knife-Drop-Point/dp/B06XKRZX76) – Always in my pocket. I never realized how handy a pocket knife could be until I started carrying one everywhere.
* [**Bellroy Note Sleeve Wallet**](https://bellroy.com/products/note-sleeve-wallet/leather/teal#image-0) – Feels great, works great.
* [**Bellroy Field Notes Notebook Cover**](https://bellroy.com/products/field-notes-notebook-cover-mini/leather/charcoal#image-1) – A great way to carry my ever-present Field Notes notebook.
* [**Blunt Classic Umbrella**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M3E26F8/) – Who knew a good umbrella would make such a big difference? This is a very nice one.
* [**Filson original Briefcase**](https://www.filson.com/original-briefcase-1.html) – I've owned a number of bags and this one is the one I've settled on. Well-designed, simple, and very well-made.

Whew! That's a lot of stuff.
