# ✨ Hire Me

{>} ![Jack Baty](/_img/_2023-jack-headshot.jpg)

After co-owning and managing a **[successful digital studio](https://fusionary.com/) for 25 years**, I sold the company in 2020, after which I remained in a consulting role for another year. I’ve been on a well-earned sabbatical since May 2021.

**It’s time to get back to work.**

I am most comfortable in a digital project or engineering management role. I have extensive technical experience, so I enjoy working with engineering teams and helping them build things and solve problems. I’m good at managing digital products, understanding customer needs, and have led many large and small digital projects to successful completion.

I love helping customers with goals and requirements, and then working with development teams to make those things happen. I’m a fanatic about usability. I take a pragmatic approach to development, using the most useful components of agile methods.

I’ve worked with companies like **Steelcase**, **GM**, **Major League Baseball**, **HealthcareSource**, and dozens more. All of them would recommend me as part of the team working on their projects.

I believe that project documentation and communication are paramount, and I can write documentation as well as communicate project goals, requirements, and progress.

I am honest, reliable, and fun to work with. I’m serious when I need to be.

And finally, I have good taste. That may seem like a strange thing to end with, but I believe that good taste is critical for doing useful, beautiful, meaningful work.
