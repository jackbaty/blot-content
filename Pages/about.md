</div>

Web developer, project/product manager, and founding partner at Fusionary Media (1995-2020). I’m now looking for my next thing. I’m good at process, requirements, user experience, documentation, and product/project management. If there’s anything you think I could do for you, [hire me](/hire-me). I’ve been at this for a long time. I like to work with dev teams on whatever fascinates them.

I love photography and tinkering on the web.
