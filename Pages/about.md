I have been a web developer, project manager, and partner at Fusionary Media from 1995 until we sold the company in 2020. Iâ€™m currently on a temporary sabbatical. If thereâ€™s anything you think I could do for you, let me know. I've been at this a long time. I'm good at process definition,  requirements, user experience, documentation, and product/project management. I like to work with dev teams on whatever fascinates them.

My favorite hobbies are photography and tinkering on the web.
